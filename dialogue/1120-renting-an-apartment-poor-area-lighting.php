				<h2>Poor Area Lighting</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> I would like to speak with the manager about some safety concerns.<br> 	<b>B:</b> This is the manager. What can I do for you?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I was parking my car last night in the garage area, and it was very dark  	out there.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Is this the first time you noticed this?<br> 	<b>A:</b> The lighting has always been bad, but it seems to be getting worse.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We are trying to save electricity, so we put in new energy-saving bulbs.  	Maybe that was the problem.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Whatever the problem is, it needs to be fixed.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Why do you feel this is so unsafe?<br> 	<b>A:</b> It is unsafe because it allows people to hide in there and jump people  	and rob them.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will go out there after dark and check it out. Thanks for bringing it  	to my attention.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> Could I speak with the property manager about a problem I had last night?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am the property manager. What was the problem that you experienced?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Have you noticed that the lighting in the garage area is almost  	nonexistent?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Has this been a problem for you in the past?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I just moved here recently, so I really don't know how long it has been  	like this.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Maybe some of the bulbs were burned out.<br> 	<b>A:</b> All I know it that it feels very unsafe out there at night.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you really think it is that unsafe to have a few dark patches here and  	there?<br> 	<b>A:</b> It is unsafe because a rapist could hide in there and attack women.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will have the night manager look into it. Thank you for telling me  	about it.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I had a problem last night in the parking lot and would like to speak to  	the manager.<br> 	<b>B:</b> This is the manager speaking. How can I help you?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I got out of my car in the parking area, and the area was not lit very  	well.<br> 	<b>B:</b> How long have you noticed this problem?<br> 	<b>A:</b> This is the first time that I noticed it.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Maybe you were just parking in a shadowy area.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Regardless of the cause, the problem needs to be taken care of.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am not sure that having a few shadows here and there is such a problem.<br> 	<b>A:</b> It is unsafe because people can't see where they are walking and could  	have an accident.<br> 	<b>B:</b> When it gets dark tonight, I will take a look. I appreciate your concern.<br>
