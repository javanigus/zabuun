				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hey! Are you busy?<br> <b>B:</b> Not at the moment. What's going on?<br> <b>A:</b> I wanted to run something by you. It's an idea for work.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, shoot.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, I'm thinking of asking my boss to change the work schedule.<br> <b>B:</b> Why? What's your idea?<br> <b>A:</b> It's to change from five, eight-hour days, to four, ten-hour days.<br> <b>B:</b> Wow. That's a big change. I don't think he'll go for it.<br> <b>A:</b> It's still 40 hours per week, and everyone will get an extra day off.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't think it will work. It's not a good idea.<br> <b>A:</b> Why is it not a good idea?<br> <b>B:</b> Companies should be open five days a week. Sorry, I don't like it.  </p>
