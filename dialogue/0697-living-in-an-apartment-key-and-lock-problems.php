				<p>  <b>A:</b> Are you locked out of your apartment?<br> <b>B:</b> It appears that I am.<br> <b>A:</b> Did you forget your key inside your apartment?<br> <b>B:</b> No. I think I lost it somewhere in the city.<br> <b>A:</b> That's unfortunate. I think I could help you.<br> <b>B:</b> Really? Do you have another key?<br> <b>A:</b> No, but the landlord does.<br> <b>B:</b> He doesn't live here though.<br> <b>A:</b> I have his phone number. I'll just give him a call.<br> <b>B:</b> Thank you. If you want, I'll talk to him myself.<br> <b>A:</b> No, don't worry. I talk to him for you.<br> <b>B:</b> Please I insist. I should be the one to ask for help since I'm the one who's in need of it.<br> <b>A:</b> Alright, suit yourself.  </p>
