				<p>  <b>A:</b> Are you ready for dinner?<br> <b>B:</b> I sure am. Where are we going?<br> <b>A:</b> I thought we could try the new Italian place.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, that's so heavy.<br> <b>A:</b> That's never bothered you before.<br> <b>B:</b> I know. The food is good, but it's a ton of carbs, and calories.<br> <b>A:</b> But very tasty.<br> <b>B:</b> We should try eating healthier.<br> <b>A:</b> So what do you suggest?<br> <b>B:</b> How about the Thai Hut?<br> <b>A:</b> You know I like that place, too. So what's the difference.<br> <b>B:</b> It's just not as heavy. Let's go there, okay?  </p>
