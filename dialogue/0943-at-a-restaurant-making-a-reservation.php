				<h2>Making a Reservation</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Are you having dinner with us tonight?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes I am. I'll be out of work soon.<br> <b>A:</b> Okay, I'm thinking of the Pasta House.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, that place gets crowded. Maybe we should make reservations.<br> <b>A:</b> That's a good idea. We waited an hour the last time.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. It is best to do that first.<br> <b>A:</b> What time should we set the reservation for?<br> <b>B:</b> Well, I'll be home by 6 o'clock.<br> <b>A:</b> Okay, I'll make the call. I'll let you know.<br> <b>B:</b> That's great, thanks. I hoped they're not booked.<br> <b>A:</b> We should be able to get a table. I'll call right now.<br> <b>B:</b> Don't worry about the time. We can eat later if we have to.  </p>
