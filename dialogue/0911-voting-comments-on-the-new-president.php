				<h2>Comments on the New President</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Having a new president will change the course of history.<br> <b>B:</b> Why do you say that?<br> <b>A:</b> Well, Obama was our first black president. Now we have our first woman.<br> <b>B:</b> You think gender matters that much?<br> <b>A:</b> Absolutely! Women view things differently.<br> <b>B:</b> You don't think she'll be too soft on foreign policy?<br> <b>A:</b> No way! Look how she handled things as Secretary of State.<br> <b>B:</b> That's true. She was tough, but also sympathetic.<br> <b>A:</b> Exactly. We need someone who is more than just tough.<br> <b>B:</b> I worry about people being too tough on her.<br> <b>A:</b> She was a first lady so she knows the ins and outs.<br> <b>B:</b> She definitely has experience.  </p>
