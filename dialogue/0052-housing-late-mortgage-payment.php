				<p>  <b>A:</b> I made a terrible mistake!<br> <b>B:</b> What's the problem?<br> <b>A:</b> I made the check for the mortgage and didn't mail it!<br> <b>B:</b> When was it due?<br> <b>A:</b> Yesterday! I thought I sent it three days ago!<br> <b>B:</b> It was just an honest mistake.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you think I can send it now?<br> <b>B:</b> Well, you have to. They may charge a late fee, though.<br> <b>A:</b> I have to be more careful when making the payments.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, you do! I'd hate to be evicted.<br> <b>A:</b> Don't joke about things like that!<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry. I'll go mail the check now.  </p>
