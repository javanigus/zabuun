				<h2>Using a Copier</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> How much do I need to insert here to make one copy?<br> <b>B:</b> It depends. Do you want your copy in color or black and white?<br> <b>A:</b> I want it in color.<br> <b>B:</b> Then it will be 20 cents per page.<br> <b>A:</b> That's kind of expensive.<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah, but most of us don't have a copy machine of our own.<br> <b>A:</b> I have one, but it's broken.<br> <b>B:</b> That sucks. Well, if money's an issue, you can copy your stuff in black and  white.<br> <b>A:</b> No, it has to be color.<br> <b>B:</b> Do you really not have 20 cents?<br> <b>A:</b> I do, but I'm really cheap.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, you don't really have a choice at this point.  </p>
