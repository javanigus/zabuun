				<h2>Using a Parking Meter</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Excuse me, could you help me figure out how to use this new parking meter?<br> <b>B:</b> Sure, it was confusing for me also. Have you ever used a regular meter?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I understood the old one.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, on this one you can use coins or a debit or credit card; which one would you like to use?<br> <b>A:</b> Debit or credit card.<br> <b>B:</b> OK. Now, do you see what the rate is on the sticker?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, now that we know what it will cost, put the money or card into the machine.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I can do that.<br> <b>B:</b> Wonderful; now, this machine asks you the number of your spot, so put that in also.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I'm ready.<br> <b>B:</b> All you have to do now is take your receipt and put it on your dashboard.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Whoa, I never saw a meter like this before; how do you use it?<br> <b>B:</b> It's simple, once you do it a few times. Do you know how the old one worked?<br> <b>A:</b> I never used a parking meter before.<br> <b>B:</b> So we start out by deciding whether you will use cash or a credit or debit  card.<br> <b>A:</b> Cash.<br> <b>B:</b> Fine, can you read the rate on the display?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I can.<br> <b>B:</b> Fine. Now that we know what they are ripping us off for, insert the payment.<br> <b>A:</b> I'd rather not pay, but I have to.<br> <b>B:</b> Fine, this machine does not ask you the number of your spot, so we can move  on, all right?<br> <b>A:</b> Perfect, let's do it.<br> <b>B:</b> Now just check the meter to see how many minutes you have.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> This parking meter is really confusing. Can you help me figure it out?<br> <b>B:</b> It's just like the old one, but with new stuff added.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, OK.<br> <b>B:</b> The first step is deciding on debit or credit card payment, so which one is  it?<br> <b>A:</b> I have coins.<br> <b>B:</b> Perfect. Now, can you see the rate on the sign?<br> <b>A:</b> I didn't see that, but now I do.<br> <b>B:</b> Once you know what it will cost, put the payment in.<br> <b>A:</b> Here it goes!<br> <b>B:</b> You are doing great! Let's move on to the next step.<br> <b>A:</b> I am a little confused.<br> <b>B:</b> Just make sure that everything registered, and then you are good to go!<br>
