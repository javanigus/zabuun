				<p>  <b>A:</b> It's been very sunny lately, hasn't it?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, it has. Some rain would be very nice.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't think it will rain for quite some time.<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe we can do a rain dance and summon rain.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you really believe in that?<br> <b>B:</b> No, but who knows, maybe it does work.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't see how dancing around would bring rain.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, it would be pretty funny-looking.<br> <b>A:</b> The rain gods would laugh at us.<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe they'll laugh so hard they'll cry.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't think I want tears as rain!<br> <b>B:</b> Me neither. I suddenly don't mind the sunny weather.  </p>
