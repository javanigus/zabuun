				<h2>Finding a Job</h2>
				  	<b>A:</b> What should I do when I find a job?<br> 	<b>B:</b> There are a few considerations. Is this a part-time or full-time job?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Does it make a difference?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Basically, you really don't need to do much of anything. On the Continued  	Claim Form, you will note that you now have a new job and also note what you  	are earning.<br> 	<b>A:</b> If I get work for a few weeks, will I be terminated from EDD?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You will not mess up your job benefits by taking work. You can always  	come back and notify EDD that you are once again in need of assistance.<br>  <hr>                <b>A:</b> Should I tell EDD that I have found a job?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Is this a temporary job or something more permanent?<br> 	<b>A:</b> What difference does it make?<br> 	<b>B:</b> When you get your next Continued Claim Form, you should just write down  	where you worked and note that you no longer need unemployment.<br> 	<b>A:</b> If I take a short job and then get laid off, will I be starting over  	trying to get unemployment?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Just because you work for a week doesn't mean that you will be losing  	your benefits.<br>  <hr>                <b>A:</b> How do I know when to tell EDD that have I started a new job?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Work is work, whether it's a part-time or temporary job or a full-time  	gig.<br> 	<b>A:</b> So I guess I have to report that I've found a little bit of work.<br> 	<b>B:</b> All you need to do is fill in the blanks correctly on the Continued Claim  	Form, and the EDD Office will take care of the rest.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What about if I find a job that I know will only last for a couple of  	weeks? Can I take it?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is to your advantage to work as much as you can.<br>
