				<p>  <b>A:</b> I heard that your brother is in the hospital.<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah. He's been there since last week.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, no. What happened? Is he alright?<br> <b>B:</b> He got in a car accident. He should be alright.<br> <b>A:</b> The doctors told you he would be alright?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, but they need to keep him for further tests.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, okay. I was so worried when I heard this.<br> <b>B:</b> Thanks, but everything should be fine. He was lucky.<br> <b>A:</b> Really lucky. Did anyone else get injured?<br> <b>B:</b> His girlfriend broke her arm, but that's all.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, that's not good.
