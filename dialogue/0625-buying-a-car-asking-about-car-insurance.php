				<h2>Asking about Car Insurance</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hello, I wanted to ask you about car insurance prices.<br> <b>B:</b> Sure thing. Please, have a seat.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you. I just bought my first car.<br> <b>B:</b> Great, congratulations! What kind of car is it?<br> <b>A:</b> It's a 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, so it's an older make.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, but it's in good condition. So, how much would the payments be?<br> <b>B:</b> Depends. Have you been in any accidents?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I have not.<br> <b>B:</b> Have you gotten any driving tickets?<br> <b>A:</b> Nope. That can affect the insurance rate?<br> <b>B:</b> At times. Well, everything seems in order. You would have to pay $75 monthly.<br> <b>A:</b> That sounds great.  </p>
