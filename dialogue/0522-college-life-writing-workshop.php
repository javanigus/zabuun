				<p>  <b>A:</b> Want to go to the writing workshop with me today?<br> <b>B:</b> Nah man, my writing skills is tight.<br> <b>A:</b> You mean "are" instead of "is," right?<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah, of course!<br> <b>A:</b> You should come with me. Our college has great workshops.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't want to look stupid.<br> <b>A:</b> You won't. You look stupid using incorrect grammar.<br> <b>B:</b> Fine. How long is the workshop?<br> <b>A:</b> It's about an hour.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't think my attention span is more than 5 minutes.<br> <b>A:</b> Don't worry, I'll pinch you to wake you up.<br> <b>B:</b> That's a clever idea.  </p>
