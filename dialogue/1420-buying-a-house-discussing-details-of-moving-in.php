				<h1>Buying a House</h1>
				<h2>Discussing Details of Moving in</h2>
				  	<b>A:</b> When can I move into my new house?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday, so technically you  	could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Will the utilities be turned on?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer  	the utilities to your name.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned.<br> 	<b>B:</b> If I were you, I would take a few days to take care of those things  	before you move in.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are  	moving in.<br> 	<b>B:</b> That would be perfect. That way, someone will be there, but you will have  	them right away.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can you help me on my move-in day?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think that I have something else really important to do on that day. I  	just can't remember what it is.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> What would be a good day to finally move into the house?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can pick up your keys on Tuesday night. When you actually move in is  	up to you.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Will the electricity and water be on, or do we need to do something to  	get it turned on?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Make sure that you transfer the utilities to your name and tell them when  	you will be moving in.<br> 	<b>A:</b> The carpet needs to be cleaned, and I want to paint the walls a different  	color.<br> 	<b>B:</b> An empty house is easier to paint and clean. Take a few days to take care  	of those things before you start moving your furniture in.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think that will work out just fine. It will help when you move your  	groceries in and need to keep them cold.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Would you be willing to help me do a few things on the day I move in?<br> 	<b>B:</b> My grandmother needs me to help her trim her roses that day.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The keys will be turned in on Tuesday night. The house will be yours at  	that time.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water  	turned on?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can tell the utility company what day you are moving in, and they  	will transfer the utilities to your name.<br> 	<b>A:</b> There are a few things that we want to do to the place, like painting and  	carpet cleaning.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Take advantage of the house being empty to clean and paint. It will be  	harder to do after the furniture and appliances have arrived.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving  	in.<br> 	<b>B:</b> That will be good. You are going to want your stove and refrigerator  	right away.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I could use some help on moving day. What are you doing on Saturday?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think I am getting a fever and will be too sick to help you. Here, feel  	how hot my head is!<br>
