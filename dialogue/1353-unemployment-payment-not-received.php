				<h1>Unemployment</h1>
				<h2>Payment Not Received</h2>
				          <b>A:</b> I am calling to find out why I didn't receive an unemployment check this  	week.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think I forgot to send it in!<br> 	<b>B:</b> You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you  	want to get paid.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can I send it in now?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than  	fourteen days since it was due. If it hasn't been, we will still accept it.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can I mail it in early next time so it isn't late?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Actually, you cannot mail it in early, as it needs to reflect all of the  	information up to the due date.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Will my paycheck come right away now?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Your check will arrive a little late.<br>  <hr>                <b>A:</b> Could you help me figure out why I am missing my unemployment check for  	this week?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I hope that you remembered to send in your last Continued Claim Form.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am pretty sure that I didn't send that claim form in.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You have to send that form in every two weeks so we that we will know  	what to pay you.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can I mail it in late?<br> 	<b>B:</b> If it is not more than fourteen days past its due date, then you may  	still mail it in.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that I will mail it in right away when I get it next time, so I  	won't be late.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can't mail it in early because you don't know, in advance, how much  	you will be working.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Even though I was late turning in my form, will my paycheck be late?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, your check will be a little late in getting to you.<br>  <hr>                 <b>A:</b> I didn't receive an unemployment check this week and need to know why.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Did you mail us your last Continued Claim Form?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am afraid that I forgot to send it in.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We cannot pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Is it too late to mail the Continued Claim Form in now?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It can't be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can't possibly know in advance how much you will be working. If you  	mail it in too soon, we will reject it!<br> 	<b>A:</b> Will my paycheck arrive late because I messed up on my form?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Your check will be arriving late, but the next one will come right on  	time.<br>
