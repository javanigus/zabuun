				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hello. What are you doing here?<br> <b>B:</b> Hi! I lost my job, so here I am at the EDD.<br> <b>A:</b> That's rough. I lost my job three months ago.<br> <b>B:</b> I didn't know that. Maybe you can help me apply.<br> <b>A:</b> Sure, I can help. You just need some basic information about your job history.<br> <b>B:</b> I have that information for the company I last worked for.<br> <b>A:</b> They ask for information on all places you worked for the last 18 months.<br> <b>B:</b> I can get that. What else do they ask?<br> <b>A:</b> Name, residence, addresses, that kind of stuff, and most importantly, why you're not working.<br> <b>B:</b> You mean if I quit, or was fired.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, and be truthful. They will call your former employers.<br> <b>A:</b> Thanks. That helps a lot.  </p>
