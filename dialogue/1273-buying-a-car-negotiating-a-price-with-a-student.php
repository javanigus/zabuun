				<h1>Buying a Car</h1>
				<h2>Negotiating a Price with a Student</h2>
				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> This car is exactly what I want!<br> <b>B:</b> I am glad that you like it. I've had good experiences with this car.<br> <b>A:</b> So, how much do you want for the car?<br> <b>B:</b> Well, the price in the paper was five thousand dollars.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I know, but I think that might be a little high for this car.<br> <b>B:</b> I might be able to come down a little on the price.<br> <b>A:</b> How about selling the car for four thousand?<br> <b>B:</b> No, that's way less than I could accept. However, I could accept forty-five  hundred.<br> <b>A:</b> That sounds fair to me.<br> <b>B:</b> It's a deal then. Thank you!<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I really love this car!<br> <b>B:</b> Great! I was hoping that it would go to a driver who appreciates it.<br> <b>A:</b> How much are you willing to take for the car?<br> <b>B:</b> As I am sure you noticed, the price on the window is five thousand dollars.<br> <b>A:</b> Don't you think you could come down a bit on the price?<br> <b>B:</b> You seem like a nice person. Maybe I could lower the price a bit.<br> <b>A:</b> Would you sell it to me for four thousand?<br> <b>B:</b> I am thinking more in the line of four thousand five hundred.<br> <b>A:</b> I'll take it then!<br> <b>B:</b> Perfect! That works for both of us.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I am definitely interested in buying this car.<br> <b>B:</b> Wonderful! It's good to find a person who really needs this car.<br> <b>A:</b> What is the price for this car?<br> <b>B:</b> The price I listed on eBay was five thousand dollars.<br> <b>A:</b> I was thinking that maybe you might be willing to lower the price a bit.<br> <b>B:</b> You know I just got a good deal on my new car. I think I can afford to knock  a little off of this car.<br> <b>A:</b> I was thinking that four thousand would be a good price.<br> <b>B:</b> I couldn't go that low, but I could sell it for forty-five hundred.<br> <b>A:</b> That would work well for me.<br> <b>B:</b> It's done then. I've enjoyed doing business with you.<br>
