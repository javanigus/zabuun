				<h2>Checking Out a Magazine</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Now, you can only check out this magazine for one week.<br> <b>B:</b> Why one week? I thought the borrowing time was two weeks.<br> <b>A:</b> That's for books only.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, that's weird.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, it doesn't take that long to finish a magazine.<br> <b>B:</b> I know, but I like to take my time.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't make the rules. Would you like to check it out?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I'd like to check it out.<br> <b>A:</b> Interesting magazine choice. Reading about celebrities is not really smart of  you.<br> <b>B:</b> Don't judge me. I can't read educational stuff all the time.<br> <b>A:</b> I do! I read Time and National Geographic.<br> <b>B:</b> Everyone's taste is different.  </p>
