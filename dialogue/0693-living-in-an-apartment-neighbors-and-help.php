				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hello, neighbor. How are you today?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm fine. How are you?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm doing alright. I was wondering if I could ask you for a favor.<br> <b>B:</b> Sure. What is it?<br> <b>A:</b> I'll be away for the weekend. Could you take care of my dog?<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah, I'd love to. I'm great with dogs.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, that's fantastic! Thank you very much!<br> <b>B:</b> Is there anything I need to know about your dog?<br> <b>A:</b> Not really. She's an old, calm, and friendly dog. You'll have no trouble.<br> <b>B:</b> Alright. I'll give you a call if I have any questions or concerns.<br> <b>A:</b> I'll bring her over in a few minutes along with her food. Thanks again!<br> <b>B:</b> No problem. Have a safe trip.  </p>
