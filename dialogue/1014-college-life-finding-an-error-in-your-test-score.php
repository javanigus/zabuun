				<h2>Finding an Error in Your Test Score</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Excuse me, Professor. I think there might be an error in my test score.<br> <b>B:</b> Sure. Do you think that the total is wrong or that you got something marked  wrong that should have been marked right?<br> <b>A:</b> I think that the percentage is incorrect.<br> <b>B:</b> Let's just go over all of it to double-check.<br> <b>A:</b> Sure, let's do it.<br> <b>B:</b> Here is the answer sheet. Do you see a place where I marked something wrong  that should have been right?<br> <b>A:</b> I don't see any mistakes.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, now that we've gotten those straightened out, let's total the score.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, let's total it.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, if I total that like this and divide by this number, I get this total.  Do you agree?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, you're right.<br> <b>B:</b> Well then, we are all straight. Have a good day and thanks for bringing that  to my attention.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher.<br> <b>B:</b> Is the math wrong or the way the answer was marked?<br> <b>A:</b> I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right.<br> <b>B:</b> These things can happen; let's double-check the answers first to be sure, all  right?<br> <b>A:</b> That would be great!<br> <b>B:</b> Look at the answer sheet and compare it to your answers. Do you see any place  where I made a mistake in grading?<br> <b>A:</b> This one right here should be right.<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah, I see the same thing; now we can do the math and check that, right?<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, let's do the math.<br> <b>B:</b> I count all of the correct answers, total them, and divide by the total. Does  this look right to you?<br> <b>A:</b> Looks pretty good.<br> <b>B:</b> Thank you for caring enough to check on your scores; keep studying!<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> Could we go over some things, because I think my test score is wrong.<br> <b>B:</b> What do you think is wrong, the math or the way your answer was scored?<br> <b>A:</b> Both.<br> <b>B:</b> I am willing to take a second look because teachers make mistakes, too. Will  that work for you?<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, I'm ready.<br> <b>B:</b> Check your answers against the ones on the answer sheet and let me know where  you see the mistake.<br> <b>A:</b> These look strange.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I agree; let's move on to the calculating of the score. Would that be  OK?<br> <b>A:</b> OK, let's do the calculation.<br> <b>B:</b> We add all of these up and divide by this and that gives us this percentage.<br> <b>A:</b> I see.<br> <b>B:</b> Anytime you have a question, please feel free to ask!<br>
