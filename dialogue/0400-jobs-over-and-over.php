				<p>  <b>A:</b> Boy, I'm glad that job is finished.<br> <b>B:</b> How long did it take?<br> <b>A:</b> Four hours, without a break.<br> <b>B:</b> It's always nice to finish a job.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, it's good and bad.<br> <b>B:</b> What's bad about it?<br> <b>A:</b> When you finish, all you do is start another job!<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, that's right. It does get boring.<br> <b>A:</b> Especially if it's the same work, over and over.<br> <b>B:</b> But that's what most people do.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I guess most of us are stuck in a routine.<br> <b>B:</b> I wonder if there is any job that you don't repeat over and over.  </p>
