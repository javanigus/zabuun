				<h1>At a Hotel</h1>
				<h2>Asking for More Amenities</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> I'd like to request some more amenities.<br> <b>B:</b> Amenities? What do you mean by amenities, sir?<br> <b>A:</b> The free stuff, you know, the soap, lotion, shampoo, etc.<br> <b>B:</b> I see. Sir, if I may ask: Have you used up all the amenities in your room?<br> <b>A:</b> Not at all. I still have enough for the next few days.<br> <b>B:</b> Then what is the problem, sir?<br> <b>A:</b> I need some to keep as souvenirs!<br> <b>B:</b> Souvenirs?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, souvenirs. Trinkets to remember my trip by!<br> <b>B:</b> We do have a souvenir shop on the first floor, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> That's not the same. I never pay for hotel souvenirs!<br> <b>B:</b> I'll call housekeeping. Someone will be up with more amenities shortly.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I need more amenities, please.<br> <b>B:</b> Could you be a little more specific, sir?<br> <b>A:</b> To be more specific, the free stuff, like soap, lotion, and shampoo.<br> <b>B:</b> I understand. Now, you're saying that you've already used up all your  amenities?<br> <b>A:</b> No! I've got all I need for my stay here.<br> <b>B:</b> So, what's the problem?<br> <b>A:</b> I need souvenirs!<br> <b>B:</b> You want some souvenirs!<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, yes. Souvenirs.<br> <b>B:</b> But, sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items.<br> <b>A:</b> That's not the same thing. If you buy hotel souvenirs, they have no  sentimental value.<br> <b>B:</b> I understand, sir. I'll call housekeeping. You'll have your souvenirs  shortly.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> How do I get more amenities?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, sir. I'm not sure I understand.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm talking about the free stuff, like soap and shampoo.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, I see. So, you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities.<br> <b>A:</b> No, no. I've got plenty left.<br> <b>B:</b> Now I'm confused again! What is the problem?<br> <b>A:</b> What am I going to do about souvenirs?<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, I get it! You want souvenirs!<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I've got enough soap for my use, but no extra soap for souvenirs.<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, our souvenir shop carries all those items, and as a guest you get a  discount.<br> <b>A:</b> Please! Free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs.<br> <b>B:</b> I understand completely, sir. Housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a  moment.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Yes, I need more amenities.<br> <b>B:</b> By amenities, exactly what do you mean, please?<br> <b>A:</b> You know, the things that are free, like the soap and the shampoo.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, I got it. You've already run out of all your amenities?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I still have plenty left, even if I took three baths a day.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm more confused now than before. How is there a problem?<br> <b>A:</b> I need to take home some souvenirs!<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, finally I understand. You would like souvenirs!<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, souvenirs that I can take home and add to my collection.<br> <b>B:</b> If it's souvenirs you want, sir, just visit our souvenir shop. It has  everything.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you kidding? Whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs?<br> <b>B:</b> No problem at all, sir. Housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you  like in a bit.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I need some more amenities, please.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm not sure I'm following you, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> Specifically, I'm talking about the little things, like soap and shampoo.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, now I understand! So, you've already used up all your amenities?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I'm not even halfway through my supply.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm losing you, sir. What's the problem?<br> <b>A:</b> What's the use of going to a hotel if you don't take home souvenirs?<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, I got it. You're collecting souvenirs!<br> <b>A:</b> There you go. My friends expect me to bring home souvenirs.<br> <b>B:</b> Have you visited our souvenir shop, sir? It's loaded with all kinds of items.<br> <b>A:</b> I've never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life, and I don't intend to start  now.<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily.<br>
