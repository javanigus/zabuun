				<h2>Greetings (2)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Good morning. How are you today?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm fantastic. How about yourself?<br> <b>A:</b> That's great! I'm good, but I feel a little sick.<br> <b>B:</b> That's not good. I heard there is a flu going around.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, I have to be sure to take good care of myself.<br> <b>B:</b> Sucks that you aren't feeling well, it's a nice day.<br> <b>A:</b> It is. The sunshine makes me want to go to the beach.<br> <b>B:</b> That's a great idea, but I think you'll get sicker if you go.<br> <b>A:</b> True. Perhaps we can go some other time?<br> <b>B:</b> For sure. Let's get together next week and go if you're better.<br> <b>A:</b> Sounds like a plan. I'll talk to you later.<br> <b>B:</b> Cool, see you later.  </p>
