				<h1>Unemployment</h1>
				<h2>Reduced Payment</h2>
				          <b>A:</b> Is there someone I can talk to about a payment question?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, we can handle that here. How can I help you?<br> 	<b>A:</b> My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week's check.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Did you work at all during the last pay period?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Yes, actually, I did make a little bit of money.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form? <br> 	<b>A:</b> Yes, I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Well, we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week's  	check.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Maybe I just shouldn't show the income then.<br> 	<b>B:</b> That is cheating and, if you get caught, you will be fined and  	disqualified from collecting unemployment.<br>  <hr>                <b>A:</b> I have a question about my payment and need someone to help me.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, I would be happy to answer a question about payment. What do you  	need help with?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I can't figure out why my paycheck this week is smaller than last week's.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Did you generate any income during that time period?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I made a little bit of money, but not much.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Did that income show up on your last Continued Claim Form?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I claimed the work I did on the last Continued Claim Form.<br> 	<b>B:</b> When you are able to find work and get paid, we always take away part of  	your check.<br> 	<b>A:</b> That being the case, I don't think that I am going to show the income  	next time.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Don't do it! If you get caught making false statements, you can have your  	claim closed.<br>  <hr>                <b>A:</b> I was wondering if someone in your office could help me with a question I  	have about my payment.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.<br> 	<b>A:</b> My paycheck seems to be smaller than the one I received last week.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What about income? Did you make any money during that period?<br> 	<b>A:</b> My old employer gave us a couple days of work during that period.<br> 	<b>B:</b> When you filled out your Continued Claim Form, did you show that income?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Of course I wrote down the work that I had done on the Continued Claim  	Form.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What happens is, when you make money, we take part of your benefits away.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am not going to show any income from now on then.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I wouldn't do that if I were you. There is a severe penalty if you get  	caught making false statements.<br>
