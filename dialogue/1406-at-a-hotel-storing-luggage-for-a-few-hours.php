				<h2>Storing Luggage for a Few Hours</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> I'm checking out in about half an hour.<br> <b>B:</b> Whenever you're ready to check out, I'll be ready, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> Great! As you know however, the day in New York has hardly begun.<br> <b>B:</b> You're right. It's only 9:00 a.m.<br> <b>A:</b> Therefore, I think I'll explore New York some more. But I need to store my  bags.<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, our storage facility is merely $5 an hour. You also need to leave a  deposit.<br> <b>A:</b> My luggage isn't enough of a deposit?<br> <b>B:</b> Unfortunately, it isn't. VISA or MasterCard will suffice, though.<br> <b>A:</b> Let me put on my thinking cap for a moment.<br> <b>B:</b> Better hurry, sir. Remember you have to check out in less than half an hour.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I should tell you that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm ready when you are, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> Very good! Now, it's still morning here in New York.<br> <b>B:</b> You are so right, sir. The clock just struck nine.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm going to spend some time exploring the city. What can I do with my  luggage?<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, right here we have a storage site. Its only $5 an hour, but you need to  leave a deposit.<br> <b>A:</b> A deposit? Isn't my luggage a deposit?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, sir, but it isn't. Your MasterCard or VISA will take care of  things nicely.<br> <b>A:</b> Let me think about this.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, sir. But don't take too long. You only have 30 minutes.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Do you know that I'm checking out in about 30 minutes?<br> <b>B:</b> Just say the word, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> Excellent! Now, as you know, the day has barely begun.<br> <b>B:</b> I agree. The dew is still on the grass.<br> <b>A:</b> I want to hit a few more places in the city, but I need a place to put my  luggage.<br> <b>B:</b> We do have a storage space for your bags. There's a small charge, plus a  deposit.<br> <b>A:</b> Leave a deposit? Isn't leaving the luggage enough of a deposit?<br> <b>B:</b> Regrettably, no. But simply present your VISA to cover your deposit.<br> <b>A:</b> I'll have to think about this for a second.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, sir, but don't think too long. Your checkout is only 30 minutes away.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> In case you didn't know, I'm checking out in half an hour.<br> <b>B:</b> That won't be a problem, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> That's good to hear. Now there's still a whole New York day ahead of me.<br> <b>B:</b> You're right, sir. Your whole day is still ahead of you.<br> <b>A:</b> I still have time to explore more of New York, but I need a place to secure  my baggage.<br> <b>B:</b> We have a storage place here, but you have to leave a deposit.<br> <b>A:</b> A deposit, huh? I would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit.<br> <b>B:</b> Just present your VISA card, and there won't be any problems.<br> <b>A:</b> That deposit bothers me. Give me a minute.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, sir, but remember how close it is to your checkout time.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I'll be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes.<br> <b>B:</b> Thirty minutes or 30 seconds, sir, it doesn't matter, I'm ready for you.<br> <b>A:</b> Great! As you know, however, the day in New York has hardly begun.<br> <b>B:</b> There's nothing like getting an early start, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> What can I do with my baggage while I visit a few more tourist spots?<br> <b>B:</b> You can leave your baggage in our storage space, with a deposit.<br> <b>A:</b> Isn't my baggage enough of a deposit?<br> <b>B:</b> I wish it was, but it isn't. They will still want a credit card.<br> <b>A:</b> It's always something, isn't it? Let me think about this for a second. <br> <b>B:</b> Don't forget that you have very little time, sir, before you have to check  out.<br>
