				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hello, Mr. Rogers. How are you today?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm doing well, Wendy. How are you?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm great, thanks. So are you ready to make a decision?<br> <b>B:</b> I certainly am. I'm going with your firm.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, that's great news, Mr. Rogers.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, so what's next?<br> <b>A:</b> I have a standard contract we use. You can look it over if you like.<br> <b>B:</b> Sure I will, but can you give me an overview?<br> <b>A:</b> It basically reads that you agree to have us act as your agent.<br> <b>B:</b> I still have the final say on the deal though, right?<br> <b>A:</b> Of course, you do, Mr. Rogers.<br> <b>B:</b> I just wanted to be clear on that. Thanks.  </p>
