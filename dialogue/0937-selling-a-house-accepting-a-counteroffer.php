				<h2>Accepting a Counteroffer</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> The counteroffer we've been waiting for is here, Mr. Richards.<br> <b>B:</b> Finally. It's been nearly three weeks.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, these things take some time.<br> <b>B:</b> I know, but I wasn't happy with the original offer.<br> <b>A:</b> I think you'll be happy with this. The buyer is coming in just below list.<br> <b>B:</b> Exactly how much?<br> <b>A:</b> They came in at $415,000, with very few conditions.<br> <b>B:</b> Wow! That's only $10,000 below list. I didn't expect that.<br> <b>A:</b> Neither did I, Mr. Richards.<br> <b>B:</b> What are the conditions?<br> <b>A:</b> They're not too bad. Mostly just to fix a few minor flaws.<br> <b>B:</b> That's great. I think we'll take this counteroffer.  </p>
