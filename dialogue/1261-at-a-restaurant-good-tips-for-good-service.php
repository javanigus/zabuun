				<h1>At a Restaurant</h1>
				<h2>Good Tips for Good Service</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Do you want some dessert?<br> <b>B:</b> No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?<br> <b>A:</b> Here comes our waitress with our check.<br> <b>B:</b> The service here has been really great, don't you think?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, the service was quite good.<br> <b>B:</b> So, let's look at the check. The total is $36.00.<br> <b>A:</b> How much do you think we should leave for a tip?<br> <b>B:</b> Usually people leave 15 percent, but this was exceptional service. I am thinking  that maybe 20 percent would be appropriate.<br> <b>A:</b> I agree that 20 percent would be just about right.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, so that will bring her tip to $7.20. Add it to the $36.00 and the total  is $43.20.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, what a nice dinner that was!<br> <b>B:</b> We'll have to make sure to come back here again real soon.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Would you like some more coffee?<br> <b>B:</b> No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.<br> <b>A:</b> The waitress is bringing the bill right now.<br> <b>B:</b> This waitress has really been on top of things, hasn't she?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, this waitress did a great job.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, let's see what the damage is. The total for our meal is $36.00.<br> <b>A:</b> What do you think would be the right amount to leave for a tip?<br> <b>B:</b> Fifteen percent is a normal tip, but she really did a great job. What do you  think about 20 percent this time?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, 20 percent would be perfect.<br> <b>B:</b> Her tip will end up being $7.20 plus the bill of $36.00. The total will be  $43.20.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, that was one fantastic meal!<br> <b>B:</b> I agree. Maybe we can come back again next week.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Would you like to order anything else?<br> <b>B:</b> No, I'm good. All we need now is our check.<br> <b>A:</b> The waitress is walking over here with our check even as we speak.<br> <b>B:</b> I have never had bad service at this restaurant, but this time was really  exceptional.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, she really went out of her way to make this a pleasant dining  experience.<br> <b>B:</b> Let's take a look at our bill. The total price for our dinner is $36.00.<br> <b>A:</b> How much money should we leave for a tip?<br> <b>B:</b> I know that 15 percent is a normal tip, but I really thought that this waitress went  out of her way for us. What do you think about tipping her 20 percent?<br> <b>A:</b> She definitely deserves 20 percent for a tip.<br> <b>B:</b> So we can add her tip of $7.20 to the bill of $36.00 and the total will be  $43.20.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, what a wonderful meal!<br> <b>B:</b> It absolutely was a great meal. We'll have to return here for lunch sometime.<br>
