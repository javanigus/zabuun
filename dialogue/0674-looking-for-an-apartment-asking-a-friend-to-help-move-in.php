				<h2>Asking a Friend to Help Move In (2)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I finally found an apartment to move in.<br> <b>B:</b> That's great to hear. Kudos to you.<br> <b>A:</b> Thanks, it wasn't easy finding one.<br> <b>B:</b> Are you moving in soon?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes I am. This weekend, in fact.<br> <b>B:</b> Have you hired any movers?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I have not.<br> <b>B:</b> Why not? Don't you know of any in the area?<br> <b>A:</b> That's not the problem. I don't think I have enough to afford movers.<br> <b>B:</b> That's too bad. Is there anything I could do to help?<br> <b>A:</b> Actually, I was going to ask for your help.<br> <b>B:</b> You're going to need at least one more other person to help you move.<br> <b>A:</b> You're right about that. So can I count on you to help me?<br> <b>B:</b> You bet. I would be happy to help you move.  </p>
