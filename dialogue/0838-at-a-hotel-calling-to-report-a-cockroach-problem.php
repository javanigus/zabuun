				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hi, I'm calling from room 117, and there is a big problem.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm so sorry. What seems to be the issue?<br> <b>A:</b> The issue is a huge disgusting cockroach in my bathroom.<br> <b>B:</b> Is it just one cockroach?<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, there is only one, but it's the size of my hand!<br> <b>B:</b> Why don't you just kill it?<br> <b>A:</b> I shouldn't have to kill cockroaches while I'm on vacation.<br> <b>B:</b> Do you want me to send someone to kill it for you?<br> <b>A:</b> You can send someone, but I also want to be moved to a different room.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't know if we have any other rooms available right now.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, I'm not staying in this room if there are gigantic roaches sharing it with me.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll send someone to your room right away to see if we can move you.  </p>
