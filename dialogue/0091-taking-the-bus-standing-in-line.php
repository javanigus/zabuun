				<p>  <b>A:</b> This line is so long!<br> <b>B:</b> We've been waiting for almost an hour!<br> <b>A:</b> I guess they do a really thorough check.<br> <b>B:</b> What are they checking for?<br> <b>A:</b> They need to make sure no one is carrying any weapons.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm glad they check thoroughly for that!<br> <b>A:</b> They also have to make sure no one has drugs.<br> <b>B:</b> Wow! I guess that's why the police dogs are here.<br> <b>A:</b> Look! There are only three people ahead.<br> <b>B:</b> After that, can we board the bus?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes. We're almost there.<br> <b>B:</b> Good! I'm tired of standing in line!  </p>
