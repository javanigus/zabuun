				<h2>Adding a Class</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> I am unsure how to add a class and need help.<br> <b>B:</b> I have an opening. Do you have an add sheet for me to sign?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I have an add sheet.<br> <b>B:</b> After I sign it, you must take it to the Admissions and Records Office to add  the class. Do you know where that is?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I'm not sure.<br> <b>B:</b> When you cross the quad, the office is right in front of you. Go inside and  follow the signs to the correct line.<br> <b>A:</b> Thanks. I understand what to do now.<br> <b>B:</b> It should be easy to find. After you add the class, check with me in a few  weeks to make sure that you are on my roll sheet.<br> <b>A:</b> That sounds good.<br> <b>B:</b> Good, just make sure that you do the same thing if you ever need to drop a  class. Good luck!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Professor, can you help me add your class?<br> <b>B:</b> You have to bring me an add sheet to sign. Do you have one?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I will have to get an add sheet.<br> <b>B:</b> You must take the signed add slip to the Admissions and Records Office to add  the class. Do you know where that is?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I don't know where that is.<br> <b>B:</b> The office is in front of you as you cross the quad. The signs in the hallway  will tell you where you need to be.<br> <b>A:</b> I think I can find it.<br> <b>B:</b> You'll find it easily. Make sure you add the class and then we will look at  the roll sheet later to make sure that you were added on.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you for letting me add your class.<br> <b>B:</b> To drop a class, you need to do the same thing with a drop slip. Good luck!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I am not sure how to add a class.<br> <b>B:</b> Do you have an add sheet for me to sign? <br> <b>A:</b> I'll bring one next time.<br> <b>B:</b> When you get the signed add slip, you must take it to the Admissions and  Records Office or you will not be added. Can you find the office?<br> <b>A:</b> I think I know where it is.<br> <b>B:</b> Across the courtyard on the right is the office. Follow the signs to the  correct line. Is that clear?<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you for your directions. It's clear.<br> <b>B:</b> You can't miss it. Add the class and then come back. We'll check later to  make sure you are on the roll sheet.<br> <b>A:</b> That's great. Thank you so much.<br> <b>B:</b> Do the same thing with a drop slip if you ever need to drop a class. Good  luck!<br>
