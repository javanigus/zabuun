				<p>  <b>A:</b> My pants have a hole in the front pocket.<br> <b>B:</b> You shouldn't carry pens in your pocket.<br> <b>A:</b> Yesterday a pen fell through my pants onto my shoe.<br> <b>B:</b> Lucky for you it wasn't a sharp knife.<br> <b>A:</b> Who carries a sharp knife in their pocket?<br> <b>B:</b> Criminals, of course.<br> <b>A:</b> Anyway, I have to fix the hole.<br> <b>B:</b> You can sew it up or use an iron-on patch.<br> <b>A:</b> Tell me about this patch.<br> <b>B:</b> The patch has glue. The hot iron melts the glue so the patch sticks on.<br> <b>A:</b> That sounds a lot easier than sewing.<br> <b>B:</b> It is. But after about ten washings, the glue washes off.  </p>
