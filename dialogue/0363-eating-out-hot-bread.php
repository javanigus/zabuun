				<h2>Hot Bread</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> This hot bread is delicious.<br> <b>B:</b> I like this restaurant because they give you free bread.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, I think we are paying for it.<br> <b>B:</b> No. Look at the bill when we get it. There's no charge for the bread.<br> <b>A:</b> It is delicious, especially with butter.<br> <b>B:</b> I think we should just leave after we fill up on the bread.<br> <b>A:</b> They probably wouldn't like that.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm eating so much bread that I'm getting full.<br> <b>A:</b> Then stop eating the bread!<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, just one more piece. Pass the butter, please.<br> <b>A:</b> If I owned a restaurant, I would never serve hot bread before the main course.<br> <b>B:</b> That's terrible. I would never go to your restaurant.  </p>
