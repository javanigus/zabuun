				<h2>Preparing to Move Out</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Do you have any helpful hints for preparing to move out of my home?<br> <b>B:</b> The first thing I would do is to make a list of what needs to be done. Then  number the items as to what can be done ahead of time.<br> <b>A:</b> What kinds of things should be on my list?<br> <b>B:</b> First would probably be to get rid of any extra things that you have by  having a garage sale.<br> <b>A:</b> That is a good idea because I have way too much junk.<br> <b>B:</b> You also should schedule your moving van in advance.<br> <b>A:</b> Can I begin packing things ahead of time?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, just keep in mind what you won't be using in the near future and pack  those items first.<br> <b>A:</b> Should I schedule my utilities to be shut off?<br> <b>B:</b> You need to work that out ahead of time with your utility companies and the  new owners.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I was wondering if you had any useful suggestions for how to prepare for our  moving day.<br> <b>B:</b> Make a prioritized list of what needs to be done and when. Many things can be  done ahead of time.<br> <b>A:</b> Can you give me some suggestions for my list?<br> <b>B:</b> Many people have a garage sale to avoid moving things that they no longer  use.<br> <b>A:</b> That would certainly cut down on the price of moving.<br> <b>B:</b> Make sure that you take the time to schedule your moving van.<br> <b>A:</b> Would it be okay to get a head start on my packing?<br> <b>B:</b> Begin by packing things that you don't frequently need. Save only a few  things until right before your moving date.<br> <b>A:</b> When should I have my utilities shut off?<br> <b>B:</b> It is best for you and the new owners to coordinate the transfer of the  utilities and what needs to be turned off and on.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I want our moving day to go smoothly and am open to your suggestions.<br> <b>B:</b> I would suggest that you make a list and check off the items as you go along.  The list will get shorter as your moving date approaches.<br> <b>A:</b> What things do people usually put on their moving-out list?<br> <b>B:</b> One thing that can be done ahead of time is to get rid of excess stuff by  having a garage sale.<br> <b>A:</b> That would mean a lot less time wasted in packing up our things.<br> <b>B:</b> List scheduling your moving van as an item on your to do list.<br> <b>A:</b> Do people ever start packing a month or so before moving?<br> <b>B:</b> You can certainly start packing things that you won't be using right away.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't know if I should have my utilities shut off or leave them on for the  people who are moving in.<br> <b>B:</b> You could simply have all the utilities shut off on the day you move out, but  you might want to coordinate that with the new owners.<br>
