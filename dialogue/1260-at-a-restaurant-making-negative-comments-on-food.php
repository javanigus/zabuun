				<h2>Making Negative Comments on Food</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> George, how is your chicken?<br> <b>B:</b> My chicken tastes all right, but it is pretty dry. How is your fish?<br> <b>A:</b> My fish is pretty dry too.<br> <b>B:</b> It's almost as if this food has been sitting a little too long. It doesn't  seem fresh.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, it seems that way to me also.<br> <b>B:</b> How are your vegetables?<br> <b>A:</b> My vegetables are very soggy.<br> <b>B:</b> Mine are the same way. It seems like they've been overcooked.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't usually complain, but I think that we should mention this to the  waiter.<br> <b>B:</b> I agree. Maybe they can bring us some better food.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> George, is your chicken OK?<br> <b>B:</b> It tastes great, but it is really dry. Is your fish all right?<br> <b>A:</b> My fish is very dry.<br> <b>B:</b> I wonder if they left it sitting around too long before they served it. <br> <b>A:</b> That's exactly what I was thinking had happened.<br> <b>B:</b> Are your vegetables OK?<br> <b>A:</b> The vegetables are kind of mushy.<br> <b>B:</b> So are mine. I think they left them cooking too long.<br> <b>A:</b> The food here is usually good, so I think that we should tell the waiter that  there is a problem.<br> <b>B:</b> I think that you are right. Maybe they can give us a free dessert or  something.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Does your chicken taste all right?<br> <b>B:</b> The chicken tastes wonderful, but it is kind of dry. Is your fish OK?<br> <b>A:</b> My fish has good seasoning but is a little dry.<br> <b>B:</b> It seems as if they got busy and left it sitting before it got to us.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, maybe they are short-handed in the kitchen tonight.<br> <b>B:</b> Are your vegetables a little mushy?<br> <b>A:</b> The vegetables seem to not be very fresh.<br> <b>B:</b> Mine aren't so good, either.<br> <b>A:</b> I usually enjoy the meals here, so I think that we should tell the waiter  that there is something wrong with this meal.<br> <b>B:</b> I think that we should let someone know. They will probably want to fix the  problem.<br>
