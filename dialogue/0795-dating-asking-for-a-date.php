Maybe we could go out some other time.<br> <b>B:</b> That's so sweet of you, but I don't think so.<br> <b>A:</b> Why not?<br> <b>B:</b> You're not really my type.<br> <b>A:</b> How do you know if you won't give me a chance?<br> <b>B:</b> Well, your insistence makes you seem a little desperate.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm not desperate. I've just liked you for a long time.<br> <b>B:</b> Again, that's sweet, but I'm not interested.  </p>
