				  <b>A:</b> So, during the time that you are showing my house, how will my valuables be  protected?<br> <b>B:</b> Our real estate company takes every precaution to see that your valuables are  protected at all times.<br> <b>A:</b> How will I know when someone will be looking at my home?<br> <b>B:</b> We will typically give you at least 4 hours notice on a weekend before we  come by.<br> <b>A:</b> Will you always accompany whoever is looking at my house?<br> <b>B:</b> Your house is listed on the multiple listing. That means that people from a  variety of real estate offices will be showing your home. <br> <b>A:</b> How will the realtors get into my house if I am not at home?<br> <b>B:</b> We put a lockbox on your house. The realtors will have a key to the lockbox  and then they can get a key to your front door.<br> <b>A:</b> What about people watching my stuff during an Open House?<br> <b>B:</b> We always suggest that you either store your jewelry in a safe or move it  into a friend's house while your house is being shown.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I am worried about the security of my home while it is being shown.<br> <b>B:</b> We do everything we can to protect your home and your valuables<br> <b>A:</b> Do people just come and look whenever they want to?<br> <b>B:</b> During the week, we will let you know the night before if we will be bringing  someone by the next day.<br> <b>A:</b> I am assuming that someone from your office will always be there, right?<br> <b>B:</b> Your home is listed exclusively with our office. We will be the only ones  showing your home.<br> <b>A:</b> Does everyone have a copy of my house key?<br> <b>B:</b> Realtors have a special key to what is called a lockbox. Once they get into  the lockbox, they can get a key to the house.<br> <b>A:</b> I have heard horror stories from friends about being ripped off during their  Open House.<br> <b>B:</b> Our company has invested in several cameras that we place in the key rooms  while the house is being shown.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I have heard horror stories about people's things being stolen while their  house is being shown.<br> <b>B:</b> We have a very good track record when it comes to home security.<br> <b>A:</b> I am not so sure that I like the idea of people showing up whenever they want  to pop in!<br> <b>B:</b> We will always call at least 12 hours in advance if we are bringing someone  by to see your home.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you the only one showing my house?<br> <b>B:</b> To get maximum exposure and a variety of buyers, your home is listed on the  multiple listing. Many different realtors will be showing your home.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you have to come and let the different realtors in when they come to look  at my house?<br> <b>B:</b> The realtors can get a key to your house by unlocking a lockbox on your front  door. They use it while they are there and return it when they leave.<br> <b>A:</b> The thing I worry about the most is having my valuables stolen during an Open  House.<br> <b>B:</b> Our realtors try to be very aware at all times of who is in the house and  what they are doing.<br>
