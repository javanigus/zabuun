				<h1>Looking for an Apartment</h1>
				<h2>Policy Towards Pets (2)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Everything seems to be in order. I'm ready to move into the apartment.<br> <b>B:</b> Good, I welcome you to your new home.<br> <b>A:</b> Is there anything else I should know before I start my move?<br> <b>B:</b> Now that you mention it, yes, there is. It's the policy I have on pets.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you allow any kind of pets?<br> <b>B:</b> Only caged pets, I'm sorry to say. I hope this won't be a problem.<br> <b>A:</b> Actually, I might prove to be problematic because I have a cat.<br> <b>B:</b> There lies the problem. I'm sorry, but some of the other tenants have  allergies to cats.<br> <b>A:</b> That's too bad. I don't know what I'm going to do with the kitten.<br> <b>B:</b> Perhaps you can give it away. Do you know of anyone who might want a cat?<br> <b>A:</b> No, not really. What about you? Would you like a cat?<br> <b>B:</b> Me? Well, I've never owned a pet before, let alone a cat.<br> <b>A:</b> Cats make great companions. Please take mine. You would be doing me a huge favor.<br> <b>B:</b> Alright, why not? Bring the little fellow next time.  </p>
