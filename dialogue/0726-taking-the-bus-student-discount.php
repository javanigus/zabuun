				<h2>Student Discount (1)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Top of the morning to you, Mr. Bus Driver.<br> <b>B:</b> Hi, good morning. Where are you off to today?<br> <b>A:</b> It's my first day of college.<br> <b>B:</b> Wow, you must be very excited.<br> <b>A:</b> You have no idea how much I am.<br> <b>B:</b> Do you know how to get there?<br> <b>A:</b> It's actually just a bus ride away.<br> <b>B:</b> Are you planning on taking the bus routinely?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I am. Why to spend money on gas when I could take the bus for less?<br> <b>B:</b> You know, as a student you're eligible to receive a discount.<br> <b>A:</b> No kidding. How much is the discount?<br> <b>B:</b> Are you paying for a month pass?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, it cost fifty dollars.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, with a student discount it would cost twenty dollars less.<br> <b>A:</b> Thirty dollars for a month pass? That's quite a discount!<br> <b>B:</b> You should take advantage of it.  </p>
