				<h2>Dropping Off at the Airport</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> Can you drive me to the airport tomorrow afternoon?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I would be happy to drive you to the airport. When do you need to leave?<br> 	<b>A:</b> For an international flight, the airline wants us to check in two hours  	in advance, so I need to leave my house at 2:00.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you have a lot of luggage to check in?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am only carrying one large bag and a carry-on.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I'll bring our smaller car then. Do you know where you need to get  	dropped off?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Yes, I am flying out on Singapore Air to Sydney, so I need to be at the  	International Terminal.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Will I be able to come in with you to say goodbye?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Actually, with airport regulations being so strict, you should probably  	just drop me off at the curb.<br> 	<b>B:</b> That will work out fine. Just give me a call if anything changes.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> If you are free, I was wondering if you could give me a ride to the  	airport this afternoon.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Sure, I'll give you a ride. What time do you need to get there?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I need to leave my house at 2:00 so I can get to the airport two hours  	before my flight.<br> 	<b>B:</b> How much luggage are you bringing?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I have my carry-on, a purse, and a large suitcase.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I won't have to drive our larger car then. Do you know where your  	terminal is?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I need to be dropped off on the second level of the International  	Terminal since I am flying to Sydney on Singapore Air.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you want me to go in with you at the airport to help you pass the time  	before you leave?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I would like that, but only ticketed passengers can go into the departure  	area.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I'll drop you off wherever you need to be dropped off. See you later!<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> Could you help me out with a ride to the airport this afternoon?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I can give you a ride with no problem. What is your departure time?<br> 	<b>A:</b> My flight departs at 4:00, so I need to leave my house at 1:00 to get to  	the airport by 2:00.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Are you bringing a lot of bags with you?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am bringing my purse, a carry-on, and a large suitcase.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Your stuff should all fit in my car just fine. Do you know which terminal  	you are going to?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Since I am flying to Sydney on Singapore Air, I need to be dropped off on  	the second level of the International Terminal.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Can I go inside the airport with you and maybe we can have a drink before  	you leave?<br> 	<b>A:</b> They only allow ticketed passengers into the departure area, so you'll  	have to drop me off at the curb.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I can take you wherever you need to go. Let me know if there are any  	changes to your travel plans.<br>
