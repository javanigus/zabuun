				<h1>Selling a House</h1>
				<h2>First Appointment with Realtor</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> I am interested in selling my home and would like to know what is involved.<br> <b>B:</b> You have come to the right place. When were you interested in selling your  home?<br> <b>A:</b> I just received a job transfer and need to relocate right away.<br> <b>B:</b> How long have you been in your current home?<br> <b>A:</b> I have lived in my home for about 10 years.<br> <b>B:</b> As I am sure that you are aware, the market has fallen in the past year.  People are more likely to make money if they have owned their home for a while.<br> <b>A:</b> Will I be able to recover the money I paid for my home?<br> <b>B:</b> It is hard to say, but whatever house you buy will also be costing you a lot  less.<br> <b>A:</b> What is the next step in selling my home?<br> <b>B:</b> I would like to meet with you tomorrow to look at your property, and then you  and I can figure out a contract.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I am looking for a realtor to help me sell my home.<br> <b>B:</b> I would be happy to help you with any questions that you might have. When <br> were you thinking of selling your home?<br> <b>A:</b> I am interested in moving up to a bigger home, but first I need to sell the  one I now own.<br> <b>B:</b> Have you owned your home for a long time?<br> <b>A:</b> I just bought my home two years ago.<br> <b>B:</b> I think you probably know that the market is not all that great. You are more  likely to see a profit if you have owned for 8 years or more.<br> <b>A:</b> Will I be losing money if I sell right now?<br> <b>B:</b> It is impossible to predict with certainty what will happen, but you can  purchase a replacement home at a lower rate also.<br> <b>A:</b> What can I do next to get the ball rolling on this sale?<br> <b>B:</b> If it works for you, I would like to come over and see your home. Then we can  draw up a contract.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I am considering selling my home and would like information on doing so.<br> <b>B:</b> It would be my pleasure to answer any questions that you might have. Were you  interested in selling in the near future?<br> <b>A:</b> I am just checking out the possibility of selling, as I am thinking of moving  to Hawaii.<br> <b>B:</b> Is your home a recent purchase, or have you owned it for a while?<br> <b>A:</b> The house has been in my family for years, but I just became the owner 6  months ago when my mother passed away.<br> <b>B:</b> Housing prices have fallen quite a bit. The longer you have owned your home,  the greater the profit.<br> <b>A:</b> Am I going to lose my shirt selling my home right now?<br> <b>B:</b> It will all kind of even out. You may sell low, but you can also buy low.<br> <b>A:</b> What should we be doing to get the process started?<br> <b>B:</b> If it fits into your schedule, I could meet you tomorrow morning and we could  take a look at your property. The next step would be us both signing a contract.<br>
