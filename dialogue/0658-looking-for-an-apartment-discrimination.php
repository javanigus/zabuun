				<p>  <b>A:</b> Is there any kind of discrimination committed in the city?<br> <b>B:</b> Not that I have witnessed.<br> <b>A:</b> What about any reports?<br> <b>B:</b> Of discrimination? I wouldn't know, to be honest.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you know where I could get access to that kind of information?<br> <b>B:</b> Perhaps the police department. What made you ask in the first place?<br> <b>A:</b> I was just curious. It never hurts to ask.<br> <b>B:</b> I wouldn't worry too much about discrimination.<br> <b>A:</b> Why do you say that?<br> <b>B:</b> We live in progressive times now.<br> <b>A:</b> That doesn't mean discrimination isn't committed in this day and age.<br> <b>B:</b> I guess you are right.  </p>
