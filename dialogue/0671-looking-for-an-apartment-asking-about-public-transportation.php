				<h2>Asking About Public Transportation (2)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Do you ever take public transportation to get around?<br> <b>B:</b> Before I frequently did. Not so much anymore. Why do you ask?<br> <b>A:</b> I wanted some information about the public transportation that is available  in the city.<br> <b>B:</b> I could provide you with some. What would you like to know?<br> <b>A:</b> What kind of public transportation is there?<br> <b>B:</b> There is a local shuttle bus that could take you almost anywhere in the city.<br> <b>A:</b> It does not take you outside the city?<br> <b>B:</b> Unfortunately it does not. But it's cheaper than other public buses that do.<br> <b>A:</b> I see. And where is the nearest stop from here?<br> <b>B:</b> It's really close. Just a block away towards that direction.<br> <b>A:</b> That way? I see. Thank you.<br> <b>B:</b> You can't miss it, and you're welcome.  </p>
