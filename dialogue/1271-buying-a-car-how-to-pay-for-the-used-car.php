				<h1>Buying a Car</h1>
				<h2>How to Pay for the Used Car</h2>
				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I am buying a used car and don't know much about financing  it.<br> <b>B:</b> I can help you. Do you have a down payment?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment.<br> <b>B:</b> Good, because you will not be able to get a loan without putting some money  down on the car.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't know where exactly to get a loan.<br> <b>B:</b> Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the  dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot.<br> <b>A:</b> What is the best choice for financing?<br> <b>B:</b> It depends. The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer, but they will  oftentimes give you a loan when a bank turns you down.<br> <b>A:</b> What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan?<br> <b>B:</b> You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car.  Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance. Good  luck!<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Can you help me learn about financing options for a used car?<br> <b>B:</b> I would love to help you with what I know. I am assuming that you have a down  payment.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I already borrowed some money from my parents for the down payment.<br> <b>B:</b> That will work. A bank or finance company will not loan you money without a  down payment.<br> <b>A:</b> I am not sure who will loan money to me.<br> <b>B:</b> You can apply for a loan at a bank, credit union, or approach the used car  dealer who sold you the car. You might also try family and friends.<br> <b>A:</b> Who offers the best interest rate?<br> <b>B:</b> A credit union will usually give you the best interest rate, but the dealer  will almost always give you some type of loan.<br> <b>A:</b> Do I need any documents when I apply for a car loan?<br> <b>B:</b> Be sure that you take a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip. You will  have a few days to produce proof of insurance. Enjoy your new car!<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I need help figuring out how to pay for a used car that I am  thinking of buying.<br> <b>B:</b> I would be happy to help you. Have you saved up a down payment?<br> <b>A:</b> I will be getting money from selling my old car.<br> <b>B:</b> You really need that money so that a bank or finance company will loan you  the rest of the money that you need. <br> <b>A:</b> Who gives loans out to people wanting to buy cars?<br> <b>B:</b> Usually people go to a bank, credit union, or, if they bought the car at a  car lot, they might use the dealer finance company.<br> <b>A:</b> What is the best place to get financing?<br> <b>B:</b> The dealer will charge you a higher interest rate, but sometimes they are  your only choice if you are just starting out.<br> <b>A:</b> Will I need some documentation when I apply for the loan?<br> <b>B:</b> Just make sure that you bring them your last pay stub and a copy of the pink  slip. You can then work on getting insured. Enjoy your new car!<br>
