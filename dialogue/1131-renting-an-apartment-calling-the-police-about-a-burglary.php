				<h2>Calling the Police about a Burglary</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> Thank you for coming, officer.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What seems to be the problem?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I was in school all day and came home to a burglarized apartment.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Was the door locked when you left?<br> 	<b>A:</b> The door was still locked when I came home, so maybe they came in through  	a window.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you live here alone?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I have a roommate, but she is still at school.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Have you seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood?<br> 	<b>A:</b> No, nothing unusual.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Well, I am going to check the windows and look for fingerprints. I want  	you to figure out what is missing.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I appreciate you coming so quickly, officer.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Whoa, what a mess! What happened here?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Apparently while I was at school today, someone decided to help  	themselves to the contents of my apartment.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Was everything locked up when you left?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that they broke in through a window.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you have a roommate?<br> 	<b>A:</b> My boyfriend lives here with me, but he is out of town right now.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Have you noticed anyone unusual around lately?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Actually, my neighbor asked me if I knew who was parked across the street  	the other day.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Let's go through your rooms and try to figure out what has been taken.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> Thank God you are here, officer.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I came as soon as I could. What a mess!<br> 	<b>A:</b> When I left for school today, everything was fine. Then I came home to  	find my apartment had been broken into.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Was the door locked when you came home?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I don't think they came in through the door; maybe they entered through  	the window.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Does anyone else live here?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I live here alone.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Have you noticed any strangers or parked cars around here recently?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I really haven't been home very much lately.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Let's figure out what is missing and see if there are any fingerprints  	left behind.<br>
