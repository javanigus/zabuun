I just gave him a bath!<br> <b>A:</b> Now that I look closer, these look like footprints!<br> <b>B:</b> Well, they're not mine, they're too big!<br> <b>A:</b> They're not mine, either. I haven't been outside.<br> <b>B:</b> I think those are dad's footprints.<br> <b>A:</b> I think you're right!<br> <b>B:</b> Dad's in big trouble now.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes he is. Maybe he'll sleep in the dog house tonight.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't think the dog wants dad as a roommate.  </p>
