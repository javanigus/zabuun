				<h2>Health Insurance</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> I would like to purchase some health insurance. <br> 	<b>B:</b> Have you ever purchased health insurance before?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I have health insurance now, but I want to look into other choices.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you know if you are interested in an HMO or a PPO?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Could you explain the difference to me?<br> 	<b>B:</b> To clarify it for you, with a PPO you pay more but you get to choose your  	own doctor.<br> 	<b>A:</b> When I pay for a service, is the payment the same for a PPO or HMO?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The payments are quite a bit higher for the PPO, but you can go anywhere  	you like. <br> 	<b>A:</b> How much will an HMO cost me per month?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Go to our website and fill in the questionnaire. Once we have all of your  	information, we can give you a quote.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I am calling to purchase health insurance.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you have health insurance now?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I was on my parents' policy, but I need to start buying my own.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can purchase an HMO or a PPO. Do you know what you want?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I don't know what I want.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Let me explain it to you. An HMO is a little cheaper, but you can only  	choose certain doctors.<br> 	<b>A:</b> When I go to the doctor, do I pay the same out-of-pocket expenses for a  	PPO?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The payments are a little lower for an HMO as long as you go to their  	doctors.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How much will a PPO cost me per month?<br> 	<b>B:</b> We need to factor in many things. Why don't you come in, and we will have  	you fill out a questionnaire.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> I need information on purchasing health insurance.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Is this the first time you have had health insurance?<br> 	<b>A:</b> This is my first time buying health insurance.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You have a choice of HMO or PPO. Do you understand the difference?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am not sure what those are.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Just so you understand completely: An HMO is a little cheaper, but you  	have limited choices of which doctor you choose.<br> 	<b>A:</b> If I need to use my insurance, are the payments the same for a PPO and  	HMO?<br> 	<b>B:</b> By going to the providers on the HMO list, you save money in  	out-of-pocket expenses.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can you give me a comparison between a PPO and an HMO?<br> 	<b>B:</b> We can mail you a questionnaire and when we have all of your information,  	we will mail you a quote.<br>
