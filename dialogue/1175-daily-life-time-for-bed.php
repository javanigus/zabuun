				<h2>Time for Bed</h2>
				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> It's time for bed.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm not ready to go to sleep. I'm not tired.<br> <b>A:</b> It's quite late, and you have an early day tomorrow.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.<br> <b>A:</b> Why don't you try counting sheep?<br> <b>B:</b> I've tried that before. It really doesn't work.<br> <b>A:</b> That's beside the point, you still need to go to bed.<br> <b>B:</b> Why can't I just stay up until I fall asleep?<br> <b>A:</b> If I let you do that, then you're just going to be up all night.<br> <b>B:</b> I promise I'll go to sleep soon.<br> <b>A:</b> No, you're going to sleep now, so good night.<br> <b>B:</b> See you in the morning.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Shouldn't you already be in bed?<br> <b>B:</b> I can't sleep. I'm really not all that tired.<br> <b>A:</b> You need to get some rest, as you have to get up early in the morning.<br> <b>B:</b> It's impossible for me to get to sleep right now.<br> <b>A:</b> Just close your eyes, and try not to think.<br> <b>B:</b> That really does not work for me.<br> <b>A:</b> It doesn't matter, you need to get some sleep.<br> <b>B:</b> How about I tire myself out, and then fall asleep when I'm tired?<br> <b>A:</b> Then you're not going to go to sleep.<br> <b>B:</b> Don't worry, I'll make sure and get to sleep in a little while.<br> <b>A:</b> I want you in bed, right now, so sweet dreams.<br> <b>B:</b> Fine. Sleep well yourself.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Isn't it past your bedtime already?<br> <b>B:</b> I am not sleepy. <br> <b>A:</b> It's getting late, and you have to wake up early tomorrow.<br> <b>B:</b> There is no way that I can fall asleep right now.<br> <b>A:</b> Try listening to some soft music.<br> <b>B:</b> It won't work. I'm nowhere close to being tired.<br> <b>A:</b> I really don't care, just go to sleep.<br> <b>B:</b> What if I stay up and do something, until I get tired?<br> <b>A:</b> You'll be up all night if I let you do that.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm going to get to sleep eventually.<br> <b>A:</b> You need to go to sleep now, so go to sleep.<br> <b>B:</b> Good night.<br>
