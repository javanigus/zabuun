				<h2>Calling a Moving Company (1)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hey, were you able to find a new home to move into?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I did. Now I just have to move my things over to the new place.<br> <b>A:</b> That's great! I'm glad you found a new place.<br> <b>B:</b> Me too. Have you ever used a moving company before?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I have. And the company is not bad.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm planning on moving soon. I have never called a moving company before.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, I see. You have to call them as soon as possible.<br> <b>B:</b> Really? Why is that?<br> <b>A:</b> Moving companies tend to get booked really fast, especially during the summer.<br> <b>B:</b> That makes sense. I guess I should call a moving company right now.<br> <b>A:</b> Good luck. I hope the move transitions smoothly.<br> <b>B:</b> Thanks you for your advice. See you later!  </p>
