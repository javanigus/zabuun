				<h2>Not Feeling Well</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> So, how are you feeling today?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I'm pretty tired. I haven't been sleeping well.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you have enough time to get the right amount of sleep?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I have enough time. I just can't seem to fall asleep and stay asleep.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What time do you usually go to bed?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I don't have one time in particular. I just go to sleep whenever I feel  	tired.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Have you been under a lot of stress lately?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I just lost my job, and I am unsure about being able to find another one.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Have you ever tried doing relaxation exercises before you go to bed?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I haven't ever tried that, but it sounds like a good idea.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> How have you been doing lately?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Actually, I haven't been sleeping well. I am kind of out of it.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Is there some reason why you can't get enough sleep?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I go to bed, but I just can't get comfortable enough to stay asleep.<br> 	<b>A:</b> When do you turn in for the night?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I usually try to go to bed around 11:00 or so during the week.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep?<br> 	<b>B:</b> My mother is ill with cancer, and I think about her a lot.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you ever meditate or read before bedtime?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I usually watch a lot of television before I go to bed. Maybe I should  	try something else to help me quiet down.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> Has everything been OK with you lately?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I haven't been able to get a good night's sleep lately. I'm exhausted!<br> 	<b>A:</b> Have you been too busy to get enough sleep?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I try to go to sleep, but I just can't stay asleep.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How late do you try to go to sleep?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I go to bed when I finish my work.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition.<br> 	<b>A:</b> You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to  	clear your head.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Doing something relaxing before I go to sleep sounds like a plan.<br>
