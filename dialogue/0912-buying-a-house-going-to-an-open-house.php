				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hey Richard, are you busy today?<br> <b>B:</b> I have a couple of errands to run, but I should be done early.<br> <b>A:</b> If you have time this afternoon, do you want to go with me?<br> <b>B:</b> Sure! Where are you going?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm going to an open house in San Gabriel today.<br> <b>B:</b> I didn't know you were looking for a house.<br> <b>A:</b> I am not ready to buy today. I'm just checking the market out.<br> <b>B:</b> That's very smart.<br> <b>A:</b> I want to see what I can afford.<br> <b>B:</b> That makes total sense. Count me in.<br> <b>A:</b> Okay, then I'll pick you up at about 3 p.m. Is that okay?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I should be done by then. Thanks.  </p>
