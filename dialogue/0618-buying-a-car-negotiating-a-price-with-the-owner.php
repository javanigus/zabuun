				<p>  <b>A:</b> The test drive went well. How much are you asking for?<br> <b>B:</b> I am selling the car for $10,000.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, wow. That's a little steep, don't you think?<br> <b>B:</b> What were you thinking? Keep in mind, it's in perfect condition.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, I would want to take it to my mechanic first.<br> <b>B:</b> From the test drive, what price are you thinking?<br> <b>A:</b> I was thinking $7,500.<br> <b>B:</b> I can't do that price. I've put a lot of work into this car.<br> <b>A:</b> Let's cut to the chase. What's your minimum price?<br> <b>B:</b> I can let it go for an extra grand.<br> <b>A:</b> So, you would let it go for $8,500?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, that would be fine.  </p>
