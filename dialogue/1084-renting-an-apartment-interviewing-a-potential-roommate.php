Are you still interested?<br>   <b>A:</b> Yes, I am.<br>   <b>B:</b> I was wondering if I could ask you a couple of questions.<br>   <b>A:</b> Shoot.<br>   <b>B:</b> I just want to be sure that we get along.<br>   <b>A:</b> I agree with you 100 percent--we must get along.<br>   <b>B:</b> Are you a party animal?<br>   <b>A:</b> Oh, no. I'm a very quiet person.<br>   <b>B:</b> Great! Next: Are you neat or are you a slob?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm a pretty neat person.<br>   <b>B:</b> Are you a night owl or a day person?<br>   <b>A:</b> Early to bed, early to rise.<br>   <b>B:</b> Finally, do you smoke?<br>   <b>A:</b> Actually, I quit smoking four years ago.<br>   <b>B:</b> Excellent answers. Do you have any questions for me?<br>   <b>A:</b> Just one: Is there a parking lot?<br>   <b>B:</b> Unfortunately, you have to park in the street.<br>   <b>A:</b> Well, I'm desperate. I'll take it anyway.<br>   <b>B:</b> Great! Let me know when you're ready to move in.<br>   <b>A:</b> I think it will be tomorrow if that's okay.<br>   <b>B:</b> No problem.

We need to get along.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you like to party?<br>   <b>A:</b> I don't party, and I don't like people who do.<br>   <b>B:</b> Great! Now, are you a neat person, or do you leave trash all over?<br>   <b>A:</b> One of my mottoes is to clean as you go.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you sleep in or rise early?<br>   <b>A:</b> I go to bed early, and I get up early.<br>   <b>B:</b> And last, are you a smoker?<br>   <b>A:</b> I can't stand cigarette smoke.<br>   <b>B:</b> Excellent. Now, do you have any questions for me?<br>   <b>A:</b> Only one. Where can I park my car?<br>   <b>B:</b> I hate to tell you, but it's street parking.<br>   <b>A:</b> I don't like it, but I need an apartment now, so I'll take it.<br>   <b>B:</b> Great! Give me a call, and I'll help you move your stuff in.<br>   <b>A:</b> Will tomorrow be okay with you?<br>   <b>B:</b> That sounds good. I'll see you tomorrow.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hi, this is Albert.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hi, my name is Jack. You called about a room for rent. Are you still    interested?<br>   <b>A:</b> Yes, more than you know.<br>   <b>B:</b> I don't mean to pry, but could I ask you a couple of questions?<br>   <b>A:</b> Ask away.<br>   <b>B:</b> I don't want us to be roommates who don't get along.<br>   <b>A:</b> Yes, we must get along if we are going to be roommates.<br>   <b>B:</b> Is partying one of your priorities?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm a student. I don't have time to party.<br>   <b>B:</b> Very good. Now, do you clean up after yourself?<br>   <b>A:</b> I clean up my own mess, and I expect others to do so, too.<br>   <b>B:</b> What time do you usually hit the sack?<br>   <b>A:</b> Occasionally, I stay up late if there's a big test the next day.<br>   <b>B:</b> What about smoking?<br>   <b>A:</b> If I ever get elected President, I will ban smoking nationwide.<br>   <b>B:</b> Very good. Now, would you like to ask me anything?<br>   <b>A:</b> Yes, I have one question. Do I have to park in the street?<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm sorry. Yes, you have to park your car in the street.<br>   <b>A:</b> I hate street parking, but I need the apartment now.<br>   <b>B:</b> Very good. Just call me when you're ready to move your stuff over here.<br>   <b>A:</b> How about if I come over tomorrow afternoon?<br>   <b>B:</b> Just ring the doorbell. I'll be here all day.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hello, Albert speaking.<br>   <b>B:</b> This is Jack. Are you still interested in renting a room?<br>   <b>A:</b> Oh, yes.<br>   <b>B:</b> Would you mind answering a couple of questions?<br>   <b>A:</b> No problem.<br>   <b>B:</b> Since we might be roommates, I want to make sure there's no friction.<br>   <b>A:</b> You are right. We need to be compatible.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you go out to clubs or bars a lot?<br>   <b>A:</b> I have been to only one nightclub in my whole life.<br>   <b>B:</b> Good. Now, do you expect others to pick up after you?<br>   <b>A:</b> Occasionally I might slip up, but usually I'm clean and neat.<br>   <b>B:</b> What kind of hours do you keep?<br>   <b>A:</b> The early bird gets the worm.<br>   <b>B:</b> I hope you're not a smoker.<br>   <b>A:</b> I can smell a cigarette from a mile away. It makes me gag.<br>   <b>B:</b> Your answers are great. Now, do you have a question or two for me?<br>   <b>A:</b> Just one question. What's the parking situation?<br>   <b>B:</b> This place allows only one parking space per apartment, so you'll have to    park on the street.<br>   <b>A:</b> I don't like it, but I guess I can live with it.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay, I think we'll be good roommates. Just call me when you're ready to    move in.<br>   <b>A:</b> I can move in by tomorrow afternoon.<br>   <b>B:</b> That's fine. I was planning on being home tomorrow anyway.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hello, Albert here. <br>   <b>B:</b> Hi, Albert. I'm Jack. Are you still thinking about renting a room? <br>   <b>A:</b> Yes, I need a room badly.<br>   <b>B:</b> Can I ask you a few questions?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm an open book.<br>   <b>B:</b> I want to make sure that we get along okay.<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm with you. We both need to live in harmony.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you like to drink and party?<br>   <b>A:</b> I hate noise, and I hate loud people.<br>   <b>B:</b> Excellent. Now, do you leave a trail of trash wherever you go?<br>   <b>A:</b> A place for everything, and everything in its place.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you keep normal hours?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm usually asleep before the 11 o'clock news.<br>   <b>B:</b> You don't have a cigarette habit, do you?<br>   <b>A:</b> Cigarette smoking is the dumbest habit in the world.<br>   <b>B:</b> I like your answers. Now, are there any questions you'd like to ask me?<br>   <b>A:</b> Yes, is the parking off street, or on street?<br>   <b>B:</b> You're not going to like this. It's street parking only.<br>   <b>A:</b> That figures, nothing is perfect. But, I'll take it.<br>   <b>B:</b> You know, I think we're going to hit it off. Call me when you're coming    over.<br>   <b>A:</b> I can get all packed tonight and be there tomorrow.<br>   <b>B:</b> Just come on over anytime. I'll be here the whole day.<br>
