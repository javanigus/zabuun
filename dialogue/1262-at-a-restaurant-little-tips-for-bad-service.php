				<h2>Little Tips for Bad Service</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Do you want some dessert?<br> <b>B:</b> No thanks. We just need our check. Have you seen the waitress?<br> <b>A:</b> Where is our waitress anyway?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, the service hasn't been the best. Is that our waitress over there?<br> <b>A:</b> I'll walk over and get the bill, since I don't think the waitress is coming  over here any time soon.<br> <b>B:</b> Good idea. Just bring it back and we'll figure it out together.<br> <b>A:</b> So the bill is $36.00.<br> <b>B:</b> How much do you think we should leave for a tip?<br> <b>A:</b> My first inclination is to leave nothing for a tip.<br> <b>B:</b> I agree, but we don't really know the whole story. There may have been  problems in the kitchen beyond her control.<br> <b>A:</b> Let's leave 10%, so that we at least leave something for the service.<br> <b>B:</b> I agree. We will leave $3.60 for the tip.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Would you like some more coffee?<br> <b>B:</b> No thanks. I'm full. We need to find our waitress and get our bill.<br> <b>A:</b> Good luck finding the waitress!<br> <b>B:</b> The service this evening has kind of sucked. Is that our server over there?<br> <b>A:</b> I'll go get the check, since our server doesn't seem to be headed this way.<br> <b>B:</b> Good. I'll just stay here until you get back.<br> <b>A:</b> So the total is $36.00 for our dinner.<br> <b>B:</b> How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves?<br> <b>A:</b> I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service.<br> <b>B:</b> I kind of feel the same way, but they may have just been really short-staffed  tonight.<br> <b>A:</b> I think that we should leave 10%.<br> <b>B:</b> $3.60 will be the right amount for the tip.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Would you like to order anything else?<br> <b>B:</b> No, I'm good. All we need now is our check.<br> <b>A:</b> Our waitress has been kind of scarce tonight, hasn't she?<br> <b>B:</b> I think that is our waitress over by the bar. Boy, the service has not  been good this evening.<br> <b>A:</b> She doesn't appear to be headed this way, so I will go get the check.<br> <b>B:</b> Good. Just bring it back and we'll total it together.<br> <b>A:</b> Our total for dinner is $36.00.<br> <b>B:</b> What do you think would be the right amount to tip?<br> <b>A:</b> I kind of don't want to leave any tip for the lousy service we received.<br> <b>B:</b> I agree that it was bad service, but I heard one of the other waiters  mentioning that it was our server's first night on the job.<br> <b>A:</b> I believe that 10% is just about right.<br> <b>B:</b> I think that a tip of $3.60 will be the right amount to leave.<br>
