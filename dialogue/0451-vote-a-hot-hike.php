I don't want to see any wild animals.<br> <b>B:</b> All we've seen so far is a couple of lizards.<br> <b>A:</b> We're hiking to lose weight, not to see goats and bears.<br> <b>B:</b> I bet I've lost a couple of pounds already.<br> <b>A:</b> All you've lost is some sweat.<br> <b>B:</b> I haven't even lost one pound of fat?<br> <b>A:</b> If you want to lose fat, you've got to do this hike every day.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, but let's hike in town.
