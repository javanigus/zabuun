				<h1>At a Hotel</h1>
				<h2>Calling for a Wireless Connection</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> I'd like to order broadband internet for my laptop.<br> <b>B:</b> Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and a prompt will tell you  the payment options. <br> <b>A:</b> I don't have an Ethernet port. My computer runs entirely on wireless  service.<br> <b>B:</b> That's too bad. But there are several alternatives, if you want to hear them.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, please! Tell me about the alternatives.<br> <b>B:</b> We run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor.<br> <b>A:</b> Very good. How much does that cost?<br> <b>B:</b> The service is free to hotel patrons. However, printing costs ten cents per  page.<br> <b>A:</b> I see. And the other alternatives?<br> <b>B:</b> Alternatively, we do offer wireless in our lobby. You can bring your laptop  down here.<br> <b>A:</b> Great! What if I need to print something in the lobby?<br> <b>B:</b> You would have to use the computer lab. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I need broadband for my computer.<br> <b>B:</b> No problem. Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you're good  to go.<br> <b>A:</b> That's a problem. My laptop has no Ethernet port, it's wireless only.<br> <b>B:</b> Hmm. Well, we have some alternatives, if you're interested.<br> <b>A:</b> Go ahead. I'm all ears.<br> <b>B:</b> We have a computer lab on the first floor.<br> <b>A:</b> That's great! How much is it?<br> <b>B:</b> It's absolutely free to guests. Except for printing, of course.<br> <b>A:</b> What about the other alternatives?<br> <b>B:</b> You could use your wireless right here in our lobby.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, that's the ticket! And if I need to print something there?<br> <b>B:</b> Well, we don't have a printer in the lobby yet. You'll have to use the lab.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband.<br> <b>B:</b> There's an Ethernet cable in your room. Just plug it into the back of your  laptop.<br> <b>A:</b> I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only.<br> <b>B:</b> That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have.<br> <b>A:</b> Any alternative that works will be great.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor.<br> <b>A:</b> That sounds good. What's the charge?<br> <b>B:</b> The lab and the computers are no charge, but you have to pay for whatever you  print.<br> <b>A:</b> That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives?<br> <b>B:</b> Of course. Our lobby is set up for wireless, so just bring your computer down  here.<br> <b>A:</b> Use my laptop in the lobby? That's great! Now, if I need to print something  there?<br> <b>B:</b> They plan to install a printer here. But until then, you'll have to use the  lab.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I can't get going on my computer until I get a broadband hookup.<br> <b>B:</b> Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be off and  running.<br> <b>A:</b> That would be okay if I had an Ethernet port. Unfortunately, my laptop uses  wireless only.<br> <b>B:</b> In that case, let me tell you about some alternatives.<br> <b>A:</b> Anything to get me up and running.<br> <b>B:</b> For starters, we have a computer lab.<br> <b>A:</b> Fantastic! What do I have to pay per hour?<br> <b>B:</b> The lab is completely free. But you do have to pay a dime a page for  printing.<br> <b>A:</b> That's fine. Now tell me about the other alternatives.<br> <b>B:</b> Just bring your laptop down here to the lobby. We're set up for wireless  right here.<br> <b>A:</b> Great! I like that suggestion, but what if I need to print something there?<br> <b>B:</b> Unfortunately, you'll have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> How do I get online with my laptop?<br> <b>B:</b> Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be online in a  heartbeat. <br> <b>A:</b> I see the cable. But my computer runs on wireless only.<br> <b>B:</b> No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are. <br> <b>B:</b> Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor.<br> <b>A:</b> Great! But is it free?<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, the computers are free to guests, but you do have to pay a nominal  printing fee.<br> <b>A:</b> You said there were other alternatives?<br> <b>B:</b> Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless.<br> <b>A:</b> That sounds like a winner. Now if I need to print something in the  lobby?<br> <b>B:</b> We might have a printer here next month. But for now, you'll have to go to  the lab.<br>
