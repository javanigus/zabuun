				<h2>Negotiating a Price with a Dealer</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I liked the car, but I am not happy with the price.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, but that's the best we can do.<br> <b>A:</b> Could you talk to your manager and have it brought down?<br> <b>B:</b> I could try, but it probably won't work.<br> <b>A:</b> I can't afford $15,000. The most I can spend is $10,000.<br> <b>B:</b> Let me call my manager. He is out of the office.<br> <b>A:</b> I can pay it all off now. I don't want to be making payments.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, my manager said that we can work with $11,000.<br> <b>A:</b> I can't do $11,000. How about $10,500?<br> <b>B:</b> Let me check.<br> <b>A:</b> Great. I can pay you with a check today.<br> <b>B:</b> It seems that $10,500 will work. Let's get the paperwork filled.  </p>
