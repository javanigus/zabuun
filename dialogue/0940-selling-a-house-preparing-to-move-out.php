				<h2>Preparing to Move Out</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Honey, where are the kitchen utensils?<br> <b>B:</b> I have no idea, Alicia. They're in one of these boxes.<br> <b>A:</b> I can't believe how much work is involved in moving out.<br> <b>B:</b> I didn't expect this, either.<br> <b>A:</b> I hope this is the last time we move in a while.<br> <b>B:</b> Me, too. I thought it was just a matter of calling a moving company, but wow!<br> <b>A:</b> That's just the beginning. Everything has to be organized, and packed first.<br> <b>B:</b> It's a good thing the kids are helping.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, and your brother, too. His truck has made this easier.<br> <b>B:</b> We've stayed in this house for a long time.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes. It's time to move, but I don't want to go through this again.<br> <b>B:</b> We won't, Alicia. Remember, we got the house we wanted.  </p>
