				<h2>Checking the Apartment for Damages (2)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Would it be okay if I checked the apartment for any damages?<br> <b>B:</b> That's fine with me. Step inside.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you. I'll take a quick look around.<br> <b>B:</b> Feel free to take your time.<br> <b>A:</b> Right away I noticed some cracks on the kitchen tile.<br> <b>B:</b> Where? Can you show me?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes. It's right at the corner, next to the sink.<br> <b>B:</b> I see it. I'll have that repaired right away.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you. That would be great.<br> <b>B:</b> Take a carful look around the apartment, and tell me of anything else that  needs tending to.<br> <b>A:</b> Here's something else. These doors are kind of loose.<br> <b>B:</b> It's the screws on them. I'll have the screws replaced as soon as possible.  </p>
