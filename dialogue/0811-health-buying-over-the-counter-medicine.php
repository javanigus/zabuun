				<h2>Buying Over-the-Counter Medicine</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I have a really bad headache. What do you recommend?<br> <b>B:</b> You can purchase some over-the-counter pain relievers in aisle 6.<br> <b>A:</b> Do I need a prescription for those?<br> <b>B:</b> No. You just pick whichever brand your prefer and pay for it at the register.<br> <b>A:</b> There are so many choices.<br> <b>B:</b> If you read the labels, you can pick the one that is best for you.<br> <b>A:</b> Is there a difference between the name brand pills and the store brand pills?<br> <b>B:</b> Usually there isn't. Just compare the labels and look for active ingredients.<br> <b>A:</b> The store brand is less expensive.<br> <b>B:</b> Usually it is just as effective.<br> <b>A:</b> I sure hope so because I want to save money and not have a headache.<br> <b>B:</b> I think you can achieve both things.  </p>
