				<h2>Talking about a Professor</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr. Miller?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. Are you going to be taking a class from him?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, but I have never taken his class before.<br> <b>B:</b> He is very interesting and challenging. Is that what you are looking for?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, that's what I need.<br> <b>B:</b> He is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade. Are you  willing to study hard?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I guess so.<br> <b>B:</b> What I really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly  teacher. Do you enjoy that in a teacher?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I had a teacher like that before.<br> <b>B:</b> Did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I didn't, but that could be a good thing.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you. Good  luck!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Do you know anything about Dr. Miller's classes?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. Are you in his class?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm thinking of taking his class next semester.<br> <b>B:</b> He really knew his stuff, but he graded hard. Would that be OK?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I really need someone who is really good.<br> <b>B:</b> I didn't find it overwhelming to earn a good grade if you work at it. Can you  do that?<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe, but I'm not sure.<br> <b>B:</b> Man, this guy was so funny when he was teaching. I like that, don't you?<br> <b>A:</b> No, that stuff isn't important to me.<br> <b>B:</b> Did you know that he is a fairly new teacher and very current in his field?<br> <b>A:</b> I don't care about any of that.<br> <b>B:</b> We all are looking for different things in an instructor. I hope I've helped  you.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. Miller's classes?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm thinking about taking his class next semester.<br> <b>B:</b> He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, but I also worry about  grades.<br> <b>B:</b> Grades are important, but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is  important, too?<br> <b>A:</b> I really need to learn this stuff.<br> <b>B:</b> He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know  what I mean?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, that sounds right for me.<br> <b>B:</b> Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing.<br> <b>B:</b> I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you. Enjoy your  year!<br>
