				<p>  <b>A:</b> I really liked this car. How much are you asking for it?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm asking for $2,000. It has some minor problems.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, my mechanic told me it was a quick fix.<br> <b>B:</b> So, you want to take the car?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I could write you a check right now.<br> <b>B:</b> That sounds good. Could I cash it today?<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, go ahead. It will clear, don't worry.<br> <b>B:</b> Didn't mean anything by it.<br> <b>A:</b> No, it's cool. I know sometimes you have to wait for a check to clear.<br> <b>B:</b> Great. So, could you make it out to Michael Slender?<br> <b>A:</b> Sure thing. I'm going to put "Car Payment," under the memo.<br> <b>B:</b> Sounds good, man. I will take care of things at the DMV tomorrow.  </p>
