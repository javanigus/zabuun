				<h2>Pre-Qualifying for a Loan</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> I need to see if I qualify for a home loan.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I can help you. How much money do you make per year?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I make around one hundred thousand dollars per year.<br> 	<b>B:</b> How long have you been on your current job?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I have only worked at this job for 6 months, but I have a longer job  	history elsewhere.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you have any other outside income from rental property or a trust?<br> 	<b>A:</b> No, I only receive my salary.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you know your credit score?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that it is around 600.<br> 	<b>B:</b> By crunching the numbers and putting in your expenses, I estimate that  	you can afford a house of around five hundred thousand dollars.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I am trying to see if I can afford to purchase a home that I wish to buy.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We can figure that out right now. How much do you earn annually?<br> 	<b>A:</b> My wife and I earned one hundred and fifty thousand dollars last year.<br> 	<b>B:</b> How many years have you held your current position?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I have been at my current job for 10 years.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Is there any extra income that you receive other than salary?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I collect one thousand dollars a month from a rental property.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Have you ever figured out your credit score?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I try not to think about it!<br> 	<b>B:</b> Adding in your expenses, I calculate that you can spend three hundred  	thousand on a house.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> I want to go house shopping, and I want to know what I can afford to buy.<br> 	<b>B:</b> There is a formula that can help us figure that out. What is your annual  	salary?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I earn sixty-five thousand dollars per year.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What is the length of time that you have worked at the job you have now?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I have been at the job I now have for 2 years, and I have been with the  	company for 6 years total.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you receive any other income?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I own a small rental unit with a partner, and I receive five hundred  	dollars a month from that unit.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you know what your credit score is?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I don't know, but the last time I checked, it was very good!<br> 	<b>B:</b> You are in good shape. Figuring in your other expenses, you can easily  	afford a house costing seven hundred thousand or maybe even a little more!<br>
