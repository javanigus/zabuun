				<h2>Early Morning Class</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I have to go to bed early.<br> <b>B:</b> Why? The night is still young!<br> <b>A:</b> I have a class at 7 a.m.<br> <b>B:</b> That's tough! My earliest class is at 9 a.m.<br> <b>A:</b> That sounds amazing to me.<br> <b>B:</b> How do you stay awake in that class?<br> <b>A:</b> Before I go to class, I drink four cups of coffee and take a cold shower.<br> <b>B:</b> Interesting routine. Does it work?<br> <b>A:</b> Kind of. It's better than not doing it at all.<br> <b>B:</b> Why are you taking that class?<br> <b>A:</b> It's only offered once a year, so I have to take it now.<br> <b>B:</b> I hope the class is interesting, at least.  </p>
