				<h2>Choosing a Good Restaurant</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Devi, have you thought about where would you like to go  to dinner on Friday for your birthday?<br> <b>B:</b> I am not sure. I don't know that many restaurants around here.<br> <b>A:</b> You know, we could look online at the local Internet sites.<br> <b>B:</b> Good. Let's take a look!<br> <b>A:</b> What kind of food would you like for your birthday?<br> <b>B:</b> I enjoy Thai or Japanese the best.<br> <b>A:</b> This one, Shogun, looks good.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh yes, I've heard of that one. Everyone I've spoken with says that it is  great!<br> <b>A:</b> Would you like to go there then?<br> <b>B:</b> I think that that would be a really good choice! Let's call and make a  reservation.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Devi, do you have any preference for where you would like to  go for dinner for your birthday?<br> <b>B:</b> I don't really know where I want to go. I am having trouble thinking of a  particular restaurant.<br> <b>A:</b> There is a great restaurant directory here in the weekend section of the  newspaper.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, we could look at that.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you have a particular type of food that you would like?<br> <b>B:</b> I really like Japanese or Thai food.<br> <b>A:</b> That Japanese restaurant, Shogun, got good reviews.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh yeah! I saw a review of that restaurant on television. The reviewer loved  it!<br> <b>A:</b> Would that be a place that you might like to go to for your birthday?<br> <b>B:</b> That would work out great! Why don't we call and get a reservation?<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Devi, do you have a favorite place that you would like to go  to for your birthday dinner?<br> <b>B:</b> I am kind of at a loss right now to think of some place special. <br> <b>A:</b> I've got a great guidebook here of local restaurants.<br> <b>B:</b> That would be a good place to look.<br> <b>A:</b> What is your favorite type of restaurant food?<br> <b>B:</b> I like a lot of things, but Thai or Japanese would be good.<br> <b>A:</b> Shogun looks pretty good!<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, I remember that restaurant. I went there years ago. I really enjoyed it!<br> <b>A:</b> Would that be a good choice for your birthday dinner then?<br> <b>B:</b> I would enjoy going there. Let's call ahead to make sure that we can get a  table for that night.<br>
