				<p>  <b>A:</b> I think the movers are here, Brian.<br> <b>B:</b> They're here? They are early.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I know. They're an hour early.<br> <b>B:</b> We're not ready yet. I'll tell them to come back.<br> <b>A:</b> No, that's okay, dear. I'll go talk to them.<br> <b>B:</b> Are you sure?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, they can start loading the furniture while we pack the small stuff.<br> <b>B:</b> I guess that's okay.<br> <b>A:</b> We'll be fine. Most of the furniture is in the front anyway.<br> <b>B:</b> As long as they don't get in our way.<br> <b>A:</b> I'll tell them we're not done packing. It should be okay.<br> <b>B:</b> It'd better be. They're very early.  </p>
