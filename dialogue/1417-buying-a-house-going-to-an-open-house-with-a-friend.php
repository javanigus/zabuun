				<h2>Going to an Open House with a Friend</h2>

Is it on our Open House list?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Yes, it is on our list.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Well, it looks great from the curb. Let's go on inside.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Let's sign the registry. The realtor looks kind of busy right now.<br> 	<b>B:</b> OK, let's go check out the kitchen next.<br> 	<b>A:</b> look, they have some refreshments in here.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Make sure that you pick up a flyer with the information about the home.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Does it say how much they are asking for this house?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, it seems to have been discounted from two hundred and thirty-five  	thousand to two hundred and twenty-five thousand.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I see an Open House sign over there, and I think we should go check it  	out.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think that looks like a very nice house.

What a great front entryway!<br> 	<b>A:</b> We need to make sure to put our names in the registry so the realtor  	knows we were here.<br> 	<b>B:</b> That works for me. We can check out the kitchen next.<br> 	<b>A:</b> On such a hot day, it is thoughtful to have water out for potential  	buyers.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Check out the flyer with all of the home's information on it.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What is the price of this house in the flyer?<br> 	<b>B:</b> They have changed the asking price since it first went on the market. It  	is now two hundred and twenty-five thousand.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> I want to take a look at that home with the Open House flags out front.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What a wonderful neighborhood! Can you find that house on our Open House  	list?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Yes, that is one of the houses that we have on our list.<br> 	<b>B:</b> They always make the front yards look so great for Open Houses. Let's see  	what the inside looks like.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent  	know that we were here.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Signing the registry is a good idea. I think I want to see the kitchen  	next.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot  	day.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Is the current asking price listed on the flyer?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty-five  	thousand dollars.<br>
