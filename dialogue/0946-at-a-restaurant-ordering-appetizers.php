				<p>  <b>A:</b> Now that you have your beverages, can I offer you some appetizers?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, that sounds good. What do you have?<br> <b>A:</b> We have a wide selection of tempting appetizers.<br> <b>B:</b> May I see a menu, please?<br> <b>A:</b> Certainly. It's on the regular menu under "Appetizers."<br> <b>B:</b> Can you recommend something?<br> <b>A:</b> Of course. The potato skins are very popular.<br> <b>B:</b> Hmmm. I don't like potatoes much. What else you got?<br> <b>A:</b> How about some stuffed mushrooms, or fried zucchini?<br> <b>B:</b> That sounds better, but I'm still not sold.<br> <b>A:</b> We have an appetizer platter that includes all our selections.<br> <b>B:</b> That sounds excellent.
