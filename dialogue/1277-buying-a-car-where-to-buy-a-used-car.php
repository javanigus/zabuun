				<h1>Buying a Car</h1>
				<h2>Where to Buy a Used Car</h2>
				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Where is the best place to buy a used car?<br> <b>B:</b> I have always purchased my used cars from an advertisement in the paper, but  actually you have many options.<br> <b>A:</b> Where else could I look for a car?<br> <b>B:</b> You could look on the Internet. Craigslist is best, as most of the cars  listed there are sold locally.<br> <b>A:</b> What would be best if I wanted to actually go see a lot of used cars that are  for sale?<br> <b>B:</b> The best place is CarMax, which is a very large used car lot.<br> <b>A:</b> Where is CarMax?<br> <b>B:</b> There are many of them. You can look on the Internet or in the phone book for  the one closest to you.<br> <b>A:</b> How about the listings on the college bulletin board?<br> <b>B:</b> Actually, that is not a bad way to go, especially near the end of a semester  as students are moving away.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Can you help me figure out the best place to buy a used car?<br> <b>B:</b> There are a lot of different ways to go. I bought my last one from an  advertisement in the paper.<br> <b>A:</b> What are my other options for looking for a used car?<br> <b>B:</b> Internet listings are good. Craigslist is pretty good because most of the  cars are sold locally.<br> <b>A:</b> I think that I might actually like to see many used cars together so I can  compare them.<br> <b>B:</b> The biggest used car lot is CarMax. I would check that place out.<br> <b>A:</b> How can I find out where CarMax is?<br> <b>B:</b> Look in the phone book or on the Internet for the one closest to you. There  are a lot of them.<br> <b>A:</b> Have you ever seen the listings on the school bulletin board?<br> <b>B:</b> The school bulletin board can have some great deals, as many students sell  their cars before they return home or as they get better paying jobs.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Where did you buy your last used car?<br> <b>B:</b> I found my last one in an advertisement in the newspaper, but there are a lot  of other places to look for used cars.<br> <b>A:</b> Besides an advertisement, what else could I do to find a used car?<br> <b>B:</b> My friend bought his used car off of Craigslist. It works out better than  eBay because the cars listed are located close by.<br> <b>A:</b> Is there anywhere I can go to see many used cars all in the same place?<br> <b>B:</b> Go to CarMax if you want to see the largest selection of used cars in one  place.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't know where CarMax is.<br> <b>B:</b> CarMax has many car lots in many cities. For the one closest to you, check  out the Internet or phone book.<br> <b>A:</b> Have you ever known anyone who bought a car off a listing on the university  bulletin board?<br> <b>B:</b> You can get a good deal there. Especially at the end of the year, when  students are selling things and returning home.<br>
