				<h2>Rejecting a Counteroffer</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Mr. Smith, we received a counteroffer on your house.<br> <b>B:</b> For which property?<br> <b>A:</b> It's for the lot on 6th Avenue.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, I've been waiting for this.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, and I think it is a very good offer.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, lay it on me.<br> <b>A:</b> The buyer upped his offer to $375,000.<br> <b>B:</b> Are you kidding me? That's still $7,500 below list.<br> <b>A:</b> I know, Mr. Smith, but the market is weak right now.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't care. I'm not losing money on this.<br> <b>A:</b> You won't be losing money, sir.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't care. I'm not selling at that price.  </p>
