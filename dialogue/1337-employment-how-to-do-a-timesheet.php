				<h2>How to Do a Timesheet</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Can you help me with my timesheet?<br> <b>B:</b> Sure! I can help you. Do you know where the timesheets are kept?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I don't know where to find one.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, once you get one off the shelf over there, you first put your name on  it. OK?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I can do that.<br> <b>B:</b> Now you have to fill in the hours in the blanks and total the hours for the  week. Do you know how to use military time?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I don't know what that is.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, so we just start counting hours at midnight and record it. Show all  minutes as a dot and then write how many minutes. OK?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I understand how to do this.<br> <b>B:</b> After you total your hours, make sure you sign it and turn it in to your  supervisor.<br> <b>A:</b> That was easy!<br> <b>B:</b> Good luck and let me know if you need any help later on.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> How do we do timesheets here?<br> <b>B:</b> They are actually fairly straightforward. Do you know where the blanks are  kept?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I already have one.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, well after you take one out of that second drawer, you put your name on  the top. Do you see?<br> <b>A:</b> I am kind of confused.<br> <b>B:</b> Next you fill in all of your hours for each day and total them. Do you know  how to show time on a 24-hour clock?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm not quite sure.<br> <b>B:</b> Midnight is zero and when you put the minutes in, make sure that you show  them with a dot followed by the minutes. Do you understand?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I have no idea what you are talking about.<br> <b>B:</b> It's easy, just write in the hours, total it, sign it, and put it in the box.<br> <b>A:</b> Thanks for your help.<br> <b>B:</b> Try it and if you can't do it, one of us can always help you later.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I need help with my timesheet.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, no problem. Have you found the blank ones?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I have seen them.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, well put your name on it after you have downloaded it off the company  website. OK?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I understand what to do.<br> <b>B:</b> You fill in the hours and total them for the week. Have you ever used a 24  hour clock?<br> <b>A:</b> What? Huh?<br> <b>B:</b> So after you noted the hours, starting at zero which is midnight, you just  write down the minutes as a dot followed by minutes. Get it?<br> <b>A:</b> Huh? What?<br> <b>B:</b> Just make sure you show your total, sign it, and turn it in.<br> <b>A:</b> I thought you said this was easy.<br> <b>B:</b> You are a quick learner. I don't think you'll have any trouble with this.<br>
