				<h2>Shuttle Bus at the Airport</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> Is this where I catch the Super Shuttle?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, this is where you catch the Super Shuttle. Where are you headed?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am headed home to Pasadena.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can tell where each van is headed by the name on the front of the  	van. I am the driver for Glendale, but your van should be along in a minute.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you know how much it costs to get to Pasadena?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I believe the cost of that trip is sixty dollars.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you know if the shuttle goes directly to Pasadena, or does it make a  	lot of stops?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Before you pay the driver, you need to ask him. He needs to be upfront  	with you about the number of stops he will be making.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do I need to have exact change?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You don't need exact change, but it is useful to have smaller bills.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> They told me inside that I should catch the Super Shuttle here.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You are in the right place to catch the Super Shuttle. What is your  	destination?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am trying to get to my home in Pasadena.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Look at the sign on the front of the van to tell where each van is  	headed. My van is going to Glendale, but yours will be along in minute.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How much does a trip to Pasadena cost?<br> 	<b>B:</b> If I remember correctly, that trip costs sixty dollars.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am hoping that this shuttle goes straight to my city without making a  	bunch of stops.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Always ask the driver how many stops he plans to make before you pay him.<br> 	<b>A:</b> If I have large bills, should I break them while I am waiting?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is better if you have cash close to the amount of the fare. There is  	an ATM machine right over there.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> Am I in the right place to catch the Super Shuttle?<br> 	<b>B:</b> This is the Super Shuttle stop. Where are you trying to get to?<br> 	<b>A:</b> My final destination is my home in Pasadena.<br> 	<b>B:</b> The destination of each van is always written across the top. I have  	Glendale written on mine, but your van will be here shortly.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What is the price of a shuttle trip to Pasadena?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The trip to Pasadena costs sixty dollars.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I need to know if this shuttle is going to make a lot of stops or go  	straight to Pasadena.<br> 	<b>B:</b> If you find out the driver will be making too many stops on the way, you  	may wish to wait for a more direct shuttle.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What should I pay the driver with?<br> 	<b>B:</b> There is an ATM machine over by that wall. It is best if you have bills  	close to the amount that you will owe.<br>
