				<h1>At a Hotel</h1>
				<h2>Disputing the Bill</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> My amenities bill says that I owe $10 for a movie, but I never  ordered one.<br> <b>B:</b> Let's see. It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p.m. for the movie  "Titanic."<br> <b>A:</b> That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, let me see what I can do.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple.<br> <b>B:</b> I can take the $10 off your bill, but I need to charge you $2 for the  service.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you serious? I have to pay $2 for a movie I never watched?<br> <b>B:</b> Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed.<br> <b>A:</b> This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again!<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I just discovered that I owe $10 for a movie that I never ordered.<br> <b>B:</b> Let me check, sir. You were charged for watching "Titanic" Monday night.<br> <b>A:</b> That is absolutely incorrect! I was out on the town Monday night.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, sir, bear with me a moment.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you for taking my word over the computer's word.<br> <b>B:</b> One slight problem, sir. I need to charge you $2 to remove this error from  your file.<br> <b>A:</b> You can't be serious. You're making me pay $2 for a movie I never watched?<br> <b>B:</b> I feel your pain, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> Absolutely unbelievable! You people should be ashamed of yourselves. <br> <b>B:</b> I agree with you, sir, but all I do is work here.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> You guys are charging me $10 for a movie that I never ordered or saw.<br> <b>B:</b> Let's see, sir. According to your file, you watched "Titanic" Monday evening.<br> <b>A:</b> The wrong information is in my file. I was at a concert Monday night.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, your word overrules the file, sir. One moment, please.<br> <b>A:</b> I knew you'd see it my way.<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, I deleted the $10, but I had to add a $2 service charge to your bill.<br> <b>A:</b> Am I in the Twilight Zone? You're charging me for a movie I never saw?<br> <b>B:</b> Please don't blame me, sir. Blame the computer programmer.<br> <b>A:</b> This is highway robbery. I've got a good mind to call the police!<br> <b>B:</b> If it makes you feel any better, other guests feel the same way.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Why am I being charged $10 for a movie that I never ordered?<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, according to your file, you spent Monday evening watching "Titanic."<br> <b>A:</b> The file is wrong. I was at a great concert that night.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, this wouldn't be the first time that a file was wrong. Just a moment,  please.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you for taking care of it so quickly.<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, when I deleted the $10, the program automatically added a $2 service  charge.<br> <b>A:</b> You can't do that! You can't charge me for a mistake that you made!<br> <b>B:</b> Sometimes you can't win for losing, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> Now I've seen it all! What a rip-off this place is!<br> <b>B:</b> I don't blame you, sir. Two dollars is a lot of money.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I need to know why I'm being charged $10 for a movie that I never  ordered.<br> <b>B:</b> Hmm. Your file shows that you watched "Titanic" Monday night.<br> <b>A:</b> Monday night? Monday night I was at a great concert.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, as they say, garbage in, garbage out. Let me correct this error,  please.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you. It's very nice when problems can be solved quickly.<br> <b>B:</b> When I deleted the $10, the computer automatically added a $2 service charge.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you crazy? You made the mistake and now you're charging me for your  mistake?<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, if it makes you feel any better, the $2 service fee used to be $5.<br> <b>A:</b> Why don't you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything I have?<br> <b>B:</b> Unfortunately, sir, you'll have to pay the $2, whether you like it or not.<br>
