				<h2>To Hold a Parcel for Pick-up</h2>

Is that okay?<br> <b>B:</b> All I need is your name, the name of your friend, and the time of pick-up.<br> <b>A:</b> All of that's on the package. Can I just bring it down to your desk?<br> <b>B:</b> That would be most convenient for me. Thanks for your consideration!<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I want to leave a parcel for a friend to pick up. Can I do that?<br> <b>B:</b> Just tell me your name, your friend's name, and when your friend is coming  by.<br> <b>A:</b> I'll put all that information on the package and just bring it down to you.  Is that okay?<br> <b>B:</b> That sounds great, sir. Thank you.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Can I leave a parcel with you for one of my friends to pick up later?<br> <b>B:</b> I just need your name and your friend's name. Also, tell me when he is coming  by.<br> <b>A:</b> How about if I write all that on the package and then bring it down to you?<br> <b>B:</b> Perfect. Thank you for doing that.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I've got a parcel here that a friend is going to pick up. Can I leave it with  you?<br> <b>B:</b> No problem. Just tell me your name, his name, and when he's coming by.<br> <b>A:</b> I'll just write all that info on the parcel itself and then bring it to you.<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, you make my work too easy. Thank you.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> A friend is picking up a parcel. Can I leave the parcel with you?<br> <b>B:</b> By all means, sir. Just give me your name, his name, and when he will be  coming by.<br> <b>A:</b> I can put all of that right on the package and then bring it down to you, if  that's okay.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, thank you for doing that, sir. I wish all guests were like you.<br>
