				<h2>Discussing Home Inspection with an Inspector</h2>
				  	<b>A:</b> I heard that you finished my home inspection, and I was wondering how it  	went.<br> 	<b>B:</b> First of all, we need to understand what I was looking for. Do you know  	what the purpose of an inspection is?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am not sure what a home inspection is all about.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I went there to check for problems with the home, so you aren't surprised  	when you move in.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Wouldn't the owners have told me about any problems?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Sellers aren't always truthful, and there might also be problems that  	they aren't aware of.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can I require the owners to fix the problems?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the  	problems.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home?<br> 	<b>B:</b> There were no major problems. One leaky pipe under the sink and two  	broken roof tiles was all that I found.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> Can you tell me the results of my home inspection?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Before I answer that, I want to make sure that you know what I was  	looking for. Are you clear on what I was looking for?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I never had a home inspection before.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I inspect the home for problems that might not be all that apparent in a  	quick walk-through.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I asked the owners, and they said that everything was great with the  	house.<br> 	<b>B:</b> The owners might not be aware of everything wrong with the house. Some  	things are hidden, but might still be a problem for you in the future.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow  	closes.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I inform you of the problems. If there are major problems, you can  	decline to buy the house or they may wish to fix any problems.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What kinds of things did you discover in my home inspection?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I found some fairly major problems. A major support beam in the roof is  	broken, and the shower floor leaked and rotted out the second-floor joist.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> I came in to see how my home inspection went.<br> 	<b>B:</b> First of all, I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is.  	Do you understand what I was doing there?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I had a home inspection before, but didn't really understand it.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it.<br> 	<b>A:</b> The owner said that the roof had leaked, but that he got it fixed last  	month.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Sellers aren't really all that objective. They may have gotten used to a  	leaky faucet, but it is still broken.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed, or maybe the price  	of the house can be reduced.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The house has a very outdated electrical system. Many of the switches and  	outlets do not work and are unsafe.<br>
