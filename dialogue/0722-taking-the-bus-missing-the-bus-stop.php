				<p>  <b>A:</b> Does this bus stop at Normandy Street?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, it does. Is that your stop?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, it is. How much further until the bus gets there?<br> <b>B:</b> Actually, the bus passed by Normandy Street ten minutes ago.<br> <b>A:</b> I missed my bus stop? Darn it, I knew this would happen to me.<br> <b>B:</b> Are you on your way to work?<br> <b>A:</b> Fortunately I'm not, or else I would've been running late.<br> <b>B:</b> Are you meeting a friend?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I am actually. I'm going to have to call him, and tell him I missed my stop.<br> <b>B:</b> You should get off on the upcoming stop.<br> <b>A:</b> Good idea. I'll just walk back to Normandy.<br> <b>B:</b> It might be a long walk.  </p>
