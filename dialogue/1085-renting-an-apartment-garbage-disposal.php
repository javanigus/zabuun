				<h1>Renting an Apartment</h1>
				<h2>Garbage Disposal</h2>
				    <b>A:</b> Hi, Tom. This is Hannah from apartment 4C.<br>   <b>B:</b> Oh, hi, Hannah.<br>   <b>A:</b> There is something wrong with my garbage disposal.<br>   <b>B:</b> Exactly what's going on?<br>   <b>A:</b> When I turn on the disposal switch, all I get is silence.<br>   <b>B:</b> When did this happen?<br>   <b>A:</b> Well, about a week ago is when it started sounding strange.<br>   <b>B:</b> Did you accidentally drop something in the disposal?<br>   <b>A:</b> No. I only use it about once a week. I hardly ever put anything into it.<br>   <b>B:</b> Actually, I've heard that too little use is bad for a disposal.<br>   <b>A:</b> Well, no one ever told me that.<br>   <b>B:</b> Did you try to turn it with the disposal key?<br>   <b>A:</b> I don't have a key.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, I've got a spare key, so I'll come over to show you how to use it.<br>   <b>A:</b> Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it.<br>   <b>B:</b> If the key doesn't work, I'll have to call the repairman.<br>   <b>A:</b> Well, if it doesn't work, it's no big deal.<br>   <b>B:</b> Yes, but if something's broken, I like to get it fixed ASAP.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Tom, are you there? It's Hannah from 4C.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hey, Hannah. Long time no hear from.<br>   <b>A:</b> My garbage disposal refuses to work.<br>   <b>B:</b> What happens when you turn on the switch?<br>   <b>A:</b> When I turn on the switch, nothing happens.<br>   <b>B:</b> When did you first notice this?<br>   <b>A:</b> A week ago it started sounding different.<br>   <b>B:</b> Did you put something in it that you shouldn't have?<br>   <b>A:</b> I use it rarely. When I do use it, I put pasta or other soft food into it.<br>   <b>B:</b> Maybe you haven't been using the disposal enough.<br>   <b>A:</b> Sort of like an air conditioner in your home or car?<br>   <b>B:</b> Exactly. However, sometimes you can get it going again by using the key.<br>   <b>A:</b> What key?<br>   <b>B:</b> A disposal key. I've got a spare one, so I'll come over to show you.<br>   <b>A:</b> Okay, come on over now, and show me how to use it.<br>   <b>B:</b> If the key doesn't correct the problem, I'll have to call someone.<br>   <b>A:</b> Well, like I said, I rarely use it so it won't be a problem.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, it's my nature to fix things as soon as I can.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Is anybody home? It's me--Hannah.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hey, Hannah. How's everything going?<br>   <b>A:</b> My garbage disposal isn't working.<br>   <b>B:</b> Can you be a little more specific?<br>   <b>A:</b> Nothing happens when I turn on the switch.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you remember how it started?<br>   <b>A:</b> about a week ago I noticed a new sound.<br>   <b>B:</b> You didn't drop a fork or anything into it, did you?<br>   <b>A:</b> I don't use it very often. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it.<br>   <b>B:</b> I've heard that disposals need to be run frequently.<br>   <b>A:</b> That's interesting. I never heard that before.<br>   <b>B:</b> Have you tried to turn it manually using the key?<br>   <b>A:</b> I don't have a key, and I wouldn't know how to use it.<br>   <b>B:</b> I've got an extra key. I'll show you how to use it.<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm always willing to learn something new. Come on over.<br>   <b>B:</b> The key might not work. Then I'll have to call the plumber.<br>   <b>A:</b> If it works or doesn't work, it doesn't matter much to me.<br>   <b>B:</b> Yes, but I prefer to fix things now instead of later.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hello, Tom? This is Hannah in 4C.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hi, Hannah. What can I do for you?<br>   <b>A:</b> My garbage disposal went south.<br>   <b>B:</b> Does it turn at all?<br>   <b>A:</b> There is nothing but silence when I turn on the switch.<br>   <b>B:</b> Did it die suddenly?<br>   <b>A:</b> It started to make a weird sound last week.<br>   <b>B:</b> You didn't try to grind up a dead body, did you?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, that's against the law, isn't it? I only use it on soft food, maybe    once a week.<br>   <b>B:</b> Strange as it seems, a disposal should be run frequently.<br>   <b>A:</b> Once a week might not be enough, huh?<br>   <b>B:</b> There's a key that will turn it manually to loosen it up.<br>   <b>A:</b> Even if I could find this key, I wouldn't know how to use it.<br>   <b>B:</b> How about if I bring one over and show you how to use it?<br>   <b>A:</b> Great, come on over, and teach me all about garbage disposal keys.<br>   <b>B:</b> The key isn't a guarantee. I still might have to call a repairman.<br>   <b>A:</b> It's no big deal to me if you can fix it or not.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, we don't want the food that's in there to start to smell bad, do we?<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hi, Tom. This is Hannah calling.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hi, Hannah. What's up?<br>   <b>A:</b> I think my garbage disposal kicked the bucket.<br>   <b>B:</b> Is it dying, or is it dead?<br>   <b>A:</b> Turning on the switch is the same as not turning on the switch.<br>   <b>B:</b> Did it make strange sounds before it croaked?<br>   <b>A:</b> Last week I noticed that it sounded strange.<br>   <b>B:</b> You haven't been putting mango or avocado seeds in there, have you?<br>   <b>A:</b> I use the disposal rarely. When I do use it, I put only soft food into it.<br>   <b>B:</b> I think a disposal freezes up when it's not used frequently.<br>   <b>A:</b> You mean it's sort of like use it or lose it?<br>   <b>B:</b> Try loosening it up by using the disposal key.<br>   <b>A:</b> Disposal key? I have a house key and a car key, but no disposal key.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, I've got an extra key. I'll bring it over.<br>   <b>A:</b> Okay, Come on over, and show me how to fix this thing.<br>   <b>B:</b> Sometimes the key works, sometimes it doesn't. I still might have to call a    plumber.<br>   <b>A:</b> Well, there's no big hurry, as far as I am concerned.<br>   <b>B:</b> If we don't fix it sometime, your apartment might start to attract bugs or    rodents.<br>
