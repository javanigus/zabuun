				<h2>Deciding not to Transfer</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I have decided not to transfer.<br> <b>B:</b> Why not? You kept saying you wanted to.<br> <b>A:</b> I know, but it's so hard getting accustomed to a new school.<br> <b>B:</b> That's a terrible reason not to transfer.<br> <b>A:</b> No, it's a good one. I feel at home here.<br> <b>B:</b> Sometimes, a new environment is necessary.<br> <b>A:</b> No, I really like it here. Also, I know what to expect.<br> <b>B:</b> I still think you're making the wrong choice. <br> <b>A:</b> Why do you want me to go?<br> <b>B:</b> I just think this school isn't right for you.<br> <b>A:</b> That's not for you to decide.<br> <b>B:</b> I know, but I'm just stating my opinion.  </p>
