				<h2>At Beach</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> What a great day to be at the beach.<br> <b>B:</b> I love the smell of the salt-water air.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you going to go swimming in that water?<br> <b>B:</b> You bet. I'm going into the ocean.<br> <b>A:</b> I actually hate swimming in the ocean.<br> <b>B:</b> Why do you like the beach then?<br> <b>A:</b> I like people watching.<br> <b>B:</b> Do you like doing that at the pool?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, but when I go to the pool, I actually swim.<br> <b>B:</b> So I guess you won't go surfing with me.<br> <b>A:</b> Nope, but I'll cheer for you from my beach towel.<br> <b>B:</b> I'd rather do something together like making a sand castle.  </p>
