				<p>  <b>A:</b> Why don't you ever answer your phone?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm usually busy. What's up?<br> <b>A:</b> I wanted to see if you were down to kick it.<br> <b>B:</b> Where do you want to go? I don't have that much money.<br> <b>A:</b> Let's go for a drink at the bar where we went last week.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, but I only have enough for three beers.<br> <b>A:</b> It's fine. I'll pay for the rest, but you owe me.<br> <b>B:</b> Screw that, I paid for you last time. You owe me!<br> <b>A:</b> Well, then we can call it even.<br> <b>B:</b> I guess so. Where should we meet?<br> <b>A:</b> How about at the train station by the bar?<br> <b>B:</b> Sounds good. I'll see you in an hour.<br> <b>A:</b> Great. See you then, laters.  </p>
