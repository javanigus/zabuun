				<h1>Selling a House</h1>
				<h2>Fixing Up the Interior</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> So what do you think I should do to fix up the interior of my house?<br> <b>B:</b> A fresh coat of paint is the number one improvement that you can make to your  home.<br> <b>A:</b> What colors do you think would be best?<br> <b>B:</b> You need to go with fairly neutral tones. You want fairly contemporary colors  that will go with a variety of furnishings.<br> <b>A:</b> After paint, what is the next most important improvement that I can make?<br> <b>B:</b> Remove any extra furnishings and personal items. Make your home look as  uncluttered as possible.<br> <b>A:</b> Should I get a new carpet?<br> <b>B:</b> Your carpet is in really good shape. New owners typically want to pick out  their own carpeting.<br> <b>A:</b> How about improvements to the bathroom?<br> <b>B:</b> New faucets are not that expensive and can quickly add a clean and more  up-to-date look.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> What are your suggestions for some inexpensive fixes to help me get the best  price for my home?<br> <b>B:</b> Painting the interior of your home is not that expensive and greatly improves  the appearance of your home.<br> <b>A:</b> Should I go for trendy colors or more traditional tones?<br> <b>B:</b> You don't want to make any dramatic statements with paint, but don't go with  just white either.<br> <b>A:</b> What else can I do besides paint the inside of my home to improve its value? <br> <b>B:</b> You need to get rid of any extra furniture or knick-knacks.<br> <b>A:</b> I need to know if I should replace the carpeting.<br> <b>B:</b> Your carpeting is very worn. You might want to explore buying some attractive  inexpensive carpeting.<br> <b>A:</b> How about improvements to the kitchen?<br> <b>B:</b> You could inexpensively replace the linoleum flooring; that would really  brighten things up.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> What do people usually do to improve the interior of their houses before they  sell them?<br> <b>B:</b> Your house looks very nice on the inside, but a fresh coat of paint always  helps brighten a home's interior.<br> <b>A:</b> I get confused when trying to pick out colors that other people might like.<br> <b>B:</b> Lighter neutral colors are usually best. They make rooms appear larger.<br> <b>A:</b> The painting suggestion is a good one, but after that, what improvement will  add value to my home?<br> <b>B:</b> Your interior should have only the most basic of furniture. Either store or  get rid of any extra clutter.<br> <b>A:</b> What about replacing the floor covering?<br> <b>B:</b> I know that your carpeting is not brand new, but with a good steam cleaning,  I think that it will look great.<br> <b>A:</b> Is there anything that I can do to the bathrooms and kitchen that wouldn't  cost too much?<br> <b>B:</b> New curtains or blinds do not cost that much and brighten up any room.<br>
