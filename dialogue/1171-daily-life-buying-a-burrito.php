				<h2>Buying a Burrito</h2>
				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Man, I'm so hungry! Can you buy me a burrito?<br> <b>B:</b> I don't have any money to buy you a burrito.<br> <b>A:</b> Please? I haven't eaten anything all day.<br> <b>B:</b> Look, I only have money to buy myself a burrito.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole cow!<br> <b>B:</b> If you're so hungry, why don't you ask someone else for money?<br> <b>A:</b> I get paid on Friday, I'll pay you back then.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, I guess on Friday, then you can eat.<br> <b>A:</b> That's pretty messed up.<br> <b>B:</b> Why don't you just go home and eat?<br> <b>A:</b> I don't want to go all the way home just to eat.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, I guess you're out of luck.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I really want a burrito! Can you get me one?<br> <b>B:</b> I haven't got any money to purchase a burrito for you and me.<br> <b>A:</b> Would you please buy me one since I haven't eaten today?<br> <b>B:</b> I only have a few dollars.<br> <b>A:</b> I could eat a horse right now, I'm so hungry.<br> <b>B:</b> I want to eat too. Ask someone else to feed you.<br> <b>A:</b> Since I get my check this Friday, I can give you your money back then.<br> <b>B:</b> So then, this Friday you'll be able to eat.<br> <b>A:</b> You're mean to say that.<br> <b>B:</b> You should just go home and make yourself a sandwich or something.<br> <b>A:</b> My house is too far, and I'm really hungry.<br> <b>B:</b> It sounds as if you're going to continue starving.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I'm starving! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm a little short. I don't have enough for you.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm starving, as I didn't eat yet today.<br> <b>B:</b> I really don't have enough money.<br> <b>A:</b> My stomach feels so empty.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, why don't you ask Bob for some money? I'm hungry too.<br> <b>A:</b> I'll be getting money on Friday, and I'll get it back to you then.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, so on Friday, you can buy yourself something to eat.<br> <b>A:</b> That's not nice. <br> <b>B:</b> You can always go home and make something to eat.<br> <b>A:</b> I can't go home yet, because I have things to do here.<br> <b>B:</b> Sorry. That's not my fault.<br>
