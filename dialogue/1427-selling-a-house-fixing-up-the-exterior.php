				<h2>Fixing Up the Exterior</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Can you help me figure out some inexpensive ways to fix up the exterior of my  home?<br> <b>B:</b> Like the interior, the number one thing you can do is to repaint the outside  of your home if it needs it.<br> <b>A:</b> What do you think of the landscaping?<br> <b>B:</b> Your lawn looks really good. Perhaps you could get some timers installed for  your sprinklers.<br> <b>A:</b> How about adding some flowers or something?<br> <b>B:</b> Colorful flowers are always a nice addition to a yard to add curb appeal.<br> <b>A:</b> What about fixing up the backyard?<br> <b>B:</b> Make sure the lawn is well trimmed and the bushes are cut back.<br> <b>A:</b> Can you think of any more overall suggestions for the exterior?<br> <b>B:</b> Wash all of the windows inside and out.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> What can I do to fix up the exterior of my home?<br> <b>B:</b> I would say the number one thing that you can do is paint your home, but your  home has been painted recently and looks great!<br> <b>A:</b> What can I do about the landscaping?<br> <b>B:</b> Your lawn looks a little dried out. I think all it needs is a little  fertilizer and water.<br> <b>A:</b> My front yard looks a little boring. How can I brighten it up?<br> <b>B:</b> I would definitely put in some new plantings to liven your yard up a bit.<br> <b>A:</b> Should I be worried about what my backyard looks like?<br> <b>B:</b> You need to repair that section where your fence is falling down.<br> <b>A:</b> What else can I do to make the exterior of the house look extra good to  buyers?<br> <b>B:</b> Make sure to keep the sidewalks and driveways swept clean at all times.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I keep hearing about curb appeal and want to know how to achieve it.<br> <b>B:</b> The paint job on your home looks pretty good, but I would touch up the wooden  trim a little where you have some peeling spots.<br> <b>A:</b> I am not so sure that everyone will like the landscaping.<br> <b>B:</b> Your lawn is a disaster! To get top dollar for your home, you should replace  it.<br> <b>A:</b> Is there anything I can do to add some interest to my front yard?<br> <b>B:</b> You have beautiful plants in your yard, although some of them aren't in bloom  right now. Just add a few colorful flowers in pots.<br> <b>A:</b> Is the appearance of the backyard important?<br> <b>B:</b> If you can borrow some really nice patio furniture to show off your lovely  patio, that would be nice.<br> <b>A:</b> Any final suggestions on how I can make the exterior of my house even more  appealing?<br> <b>B:</b> Having your trees and bushes trimmed could be a good investment.<br>
