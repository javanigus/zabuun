				<p>  <b>A:</b> Heard it's supposed to rain.<br> <b>B:</b> Where did you hear that from?<br> <b>A:</b> The news. The weatherman said there is a high probability of rain.<br> <b>B:</b> Since when have you started watching the news?<br> <b>A:</b> I've always watched the news. Well, at least to check out the weather.<br> <b>B:</b> What else did they say about the weekend?<br> <b>A:</b> I think they said it was going to rain throughout the weekend.<br> <b>B:</b> Throughout the weekend? Don't pull my chain.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm not. They said it, not me. I know you had plans.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, I don't believe it. Just like I don't believe you watch the news.<br> <b>A:</b> Okay, suit yourself. I'd take an umbrella though.<br> <b>B:</b> I won't. I'd rather get wet than listen to you.  </p>
