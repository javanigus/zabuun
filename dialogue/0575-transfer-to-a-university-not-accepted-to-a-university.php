What's wrong with me?<br> <b>A:</b> Nothing. If your dream school doesn't want you, then that's their loss.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't know what to do anymore.<br> <b>A:</b> Look, that school didn't accept you, because you weren't the right fit.<br> <b>B:</b> Is that supposed to make me feel better?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm just saying, why would you want to go to a school that doesn't fit you?<br> <b>B:</b> When you say it like that, I understand you.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah! Just focus on the schools that do want you.<br> <b>B:</b> You're right! Yale made a mistake rejecting me.  </p>
