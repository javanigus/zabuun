				<h1>Renting an Apartment</h1>
				<h2>Discrimination</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> Good morning, is this the Renter's Hotline?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, what can I help you with?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I have a question about discrimination in housing.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What type of discrimination?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that he doesn't want to rent to me because of my race.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What made you think that your race was a problem?<br> 	<b>A:</b> He seemed OK talking to me on the phone, but seemed to change his mind  	when he saw me in person.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What else made you feel he was discriminating against you?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Well, he had a 25 unit apartment building and everyone I saw there was  	his same race.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Racial discrimination is very hard to prove, but if you would like to  	come down, we can go over a checklist that can help you build a case.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I would like to speak with someone in the Housing Department.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You have reached the right area. Can I help you with something?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that I may have experienced discrimination in trying to rent an  	apartment.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Can you be specific as to what type of discrimination?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I felt that he didn't like me because I wasn't the same race that he was.<br> 	<b>B:</b> How come you feel it was race that was the issue?<br> 	<b>A:</b> When I showed up on his doorstep, he seemed bothered by my appearance.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Is there anything else that made you feel he was using race as a factor  	in who he rented to?<br> 	<b>A:</b> As I walked through the apartment building all I saw were people who were  	the same race as the manager.<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is not easy to prove racial discrimination, but please go to our  	website which can help you file a formal complaint.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> Hello, is this the Legal Advice Line?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You are in the right department. What can I do for you?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that the landlord where I am trying to rent an apartment may be  	discriminating against me.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Discrimination is a pretty broad term. What type, specifically?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I have a feeling that he will not consider my application because of my  	race.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Are you sure that race was the issue? What makes you feel this way?<br> 	<b>A:</b> When he saw me in person, he seemed bothered by me although I seemed to  	be under consideration when I e-mailed him.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you have any proof that he would not rent to you because of your race?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I didn't see one person in that whole building who wasn't the same race  	as the manager.<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is difficult to prove racial discrimination, but you may file a formal  	complaint in our office.<br>
