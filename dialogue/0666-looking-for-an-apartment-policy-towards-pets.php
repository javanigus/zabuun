				<h2>Policy Towards Pets (1)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> What's your policy towards owning pets in the apartment?<br> <b>B:</b> I usually don't permit any kind of pets.<br> <b>A:</b> Would you be willing to make an exception?<br> <b>B:</b> It depends on the pet. Are you a pet owner?<br> <b>A:</b> I have a few rabbits and hamsters.<br> <b>B:</b> How many exactly?<br> <b>A:</b> I have two rabbits and three hamsters.<br> <b>B:</b> As long as you keep them inside your apartment I don't see why they would be  a problem.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm guessing cats and dogs are not permitted?<br> <b>B:</b> Not, they are not. I'm sorry to say.<br> <b>A:</b> Did something happen that made you change your policy towards cats and dogs?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. A tenant previously owned a dog and the dog attacked another tenant one day.  </p>
