				<h1>At a Hotel</h1>
				<h2>Asking the Concierge for Restaurant Advice</h2>
				    <b>A:</b> I need a suggestion for a restaurant here in Manhattan.<br>   <b>B:</b> Certainly! How much are you planning to spend on dinner, sir?<br>   <b>A:</b> My date's very sophisticated, so I'm sure she would expect nothing but the    best.<br>   <b>B:</b> May I suggest our own hotel restaurant? It got three stars in the latest    restaurant review.<br>   <b>A:</b> No, thank you, I want to go out on the town. What other ideas do you have?<br>   <b>B:</b> There's always Gramercy Tavern. They have live jazz. The food is delicious,    but very expensive.<br>   <b>A:</b> That sounds like a good place to take a date. Can you make a reservation    for me?<br>   <b>B:</b> As you wish, sir. You'll have a wonderful time there.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to?<br>   <b>B:</b> Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal?<br>   <b>A:</b> My date is quite sophisticated. She would expect nothing less than the best.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, how about our own hotel restaurant? It's conveniently located and has    a three-star rating.<br>   <b>A:</b> That's a good idea, except I want to go out, not stay in. Something else,    maybe?<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, how about Gramercy Tavern? It's a very popular tourist spot, with    great food and music.<br>   <b>A:</b> That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?<br>   <b>B:</b> Of course, sir. You've made a good choice.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> So, now I need your help again, if you don't mind. I'm taking a date to a    restaurant.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'd love to help you! What is your budget for the dinner?<br>   <b>A:</b> She strikes me as being very sophisticated. Only the best will do for her.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, what do you think about our very own hotel restaurant? It is very    upscale, with a three-star rating.<br>   <b>A:</b> I don't want to be cooped up in my own hotel tonight. How about another    restaurant?<br>   <b>B:</b> The Gramercy Tavern is highly rated. It has great food and live jazz, but    it's not cheap.<br>   <b>A:</b> Yes, that sounds like a winner. Would you please call them to reserve a    table?<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm already dialing, sir.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I'm taking a date to a restaurant, so could you please direct me to a good    one?<br>   <b>B:</b> But of course! How much are you thinking of spending on dinner?<br>   <b>A:</b> She deserves nothing but the best, of course.<br>   <b>B:</b> In that case, I would suggest our own hotel restaurant. The chef, the food,    and the service are outstanding.<br>   <b>A:</b> I promised her I would take her out to a restaurant. Do you have another    one in mind?<br>   <b>B:</b> You can always go to Gramercy Tavern. It's quite popular, despite its    expensive entrees. <br>   <b>A:</b> Great food and lots of patrons? What more could I want? Please    reserve a table for me.<br>   <b>B:</b> Yes, sir. You're going to have a great time.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I'm taking my date to a restaurant. Could you tell me about one or    two good ones?<br>   <b>B:</b> My pleasure! How much would you like to spend on your date?<br>   <b>A:</b> She will want an excellent restaurant, of course.<br>   <b>B:</b> You should know that our hotel chef was trained in Paris. The service and    food are world-class.<br>   <b>A:</b> I wanted to go out somewhere, not stay here. Do you know of another good    restaurant?<br>   <b>B:</b> You can't go wrong with Gramercy Tavern. It's famous for its food, service,    and live jazz.<br>   <b>A:</b> I like that! Could you please call them to see if we can get in tonight?<br>   <b>B:</b> At once, sir. You'll love this place, I assure you.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> Well, I've got a date. Now I need to find a restaurant. Can you help me?   <br>   <b>B:</b> No problem, of course! How much would you like to spend to impress the    lady?<br>   <b>A:</b> Nothing but the best for a pretty woman!<br>   <b>B:</b> Sir, the restaurant you seek is right here. This hotel has a three-star    restaurant.<br>   <b>A:</b> I sort of suggested that we would go out on the town. Do you have    another suggestion?<br>   <b>B:</b> Gramercy Tavern is at least as good as our own hotel restaurant. Plus, they    have live jazz.<br>   <b>A:</b> Gramercy Tavern? I think I've heard of that before. Call to get us a    table, okay?<br>   <b>B:</b> Right away, sir. She will be impressed with your local knowledge.<br>
