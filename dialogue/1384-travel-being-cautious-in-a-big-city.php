				<h1>Travel</h1>
				<h2>Being Cautious in a Big City</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> Is there anything special I need to think about as I tour this city?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You need to keep in mind that this is a very poor country. Things are a  	little more desperate here than you are used to.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What do I need to look for?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Be particularly vigilant anytime you are in a crowded place with other  	tourists. Pickpockets know that tourists aren't paying all that much  	attention.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I have seen many children on the street begging, so what do I do about  	them?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is best not to give money to children or other beggars on the street,  	as they can swarm you. You can give money to a local charity.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Should I be concerned about what I eat or drink?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do not drink any water that isn't bottled. Avoid street vendor food.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How about being out on the street at night?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I would take a cab to your destination at night. Don't walk down the  	street alone.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> This city is much larger than the one I live in, and I wonder if there is  	anything special that I need to keep in mind.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Crime can happen anywhere, but it is a little worse here because of the  	poverty.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Should I be vigilant about anything in particular?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The train stations, airports, and tourist sites are favorite spots for  	pickpockets.<br> 	<b>A:</b> When I see children on the street begging, what amount should I give  	them?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I wouldn't suggest giving money to them. Most of them are put out there  	by adults who then take their money.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can I eat or drink anything I want to?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do not use tap water at all, not even to brush your teeth. Only eat fruit  	that has been peeled.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can I walk around and see the sights at night?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I would be sure to travel in a group at night. Stay in well-lit areas.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> Do I need to take any special safety precautions in this city?<br> 	<b>B:</b> This is a very large city with a lot of crowds to work your way through.  	Keep in mind that poverty makes people a little more desperate.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What should I watch out for?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You have to pay special attention at train stations, airports, and  	tourist sites. They are known for having a lot of pickpockets.<br> 	<b>A:</b> There are so many children begging on the street that I don't know which  	ones to give money to.<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is a natural instinct to want to give money to those children, but it  	is better to give money to one of the local charities or schools.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Are the local food and drink safe?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Avoid eating food prepared by street vendors. Use only bottled water.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How safe is it to be out at night?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You should always travel with others at night and stick to well-lit  	areas.<br>
