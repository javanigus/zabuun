				  <b>A:</b> I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the  mountains.<br> <b>B:</b> I agree, I think that that would be perfect!<br> <b>A:</b> I was thinking it could take place sometime in January.<br> <b>B:</b> That might be a little too cold for some people.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, you are right.<br> <b>B:</b> What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, that would work out better.<br> <b>B:</b> You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone.<br> <b>A:</b> Good idea! We'll have to get right on it.<br> <b>B:</b> Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains  this year.<br> <b>B:</b> What a great idea!<br> <b>A:</b> January would be a good month for a mountain retreat.<br> <b>B:</b> I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January.<br> <b>A:</b> You know, now that I think about it, you might be right.<br> <b>B:</b> April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary  arrangements.<br> <b>A:</b> That is a good suggestion.<br> <b>B:</b> We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, that would let us know what would work best.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll put the survey online this afternoon.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat.<br> <b>B:</b> That's a wonderful choice.<br> <b>A:</b> I have chosen January as the month for this retreat.<br> <b>B:</b> January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, maybe another choice might be better.<br> <b>B:</b> I think that April would work. Spring is a lovely time to be in the  mountains.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you for thinking of that.<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer.<br> <b>A:</b> That is a good idea.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers.<br>
