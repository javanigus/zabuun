				<h2>Misleading Advertisement</h2>
				   <b>A:</b> I'm glad these batteries are on sale.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry. These batteries are not on sale.<br> <b>A:</b> But that's what the ad says.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry. If you look at the ad again, you'll see that the other brand is on  sale.<br> <b>A:</b> You're right. I misread the ad.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, many people make that mistake.<br> <b>A:</b> You can't blame them. It's a confusing ad.<br> <b>B:</b> You're right. Many ads are like that.<br> <b>A:</b> As long as I'm here.<br> <b>B:</b> Just one second, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> It's about time these batteries went on sale.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry.

I've got the wrong brand.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, it's an easy mistake to make.<br> <b>A:</b> The ad is written in a misleading way.<br> <b>B:</b> I agree. It seems like all ads are meant to confuse you.<br> <b>A:</b> It's not the first or last time.<br> <b>B:</b> Hold on, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> You don't often find these batteries on sale.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm not sure that these batteries are on sale today.<br> <b>A:</b> But the ad says they're on sale.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, batteries are on sale, but not this brand.<br> <b>A:</b> What do you know?

Ads can be very tricky.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't know when I'll ever learn.<br> <b>B:</b> No problem. I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale. I'll be right  back.<br>
