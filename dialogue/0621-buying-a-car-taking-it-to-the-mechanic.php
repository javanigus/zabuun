				<h2>Taking It to the Mechanic</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I checked the whole car, and it has some problems.<br> <b>B:</b> What kind of problems does it have?<br> <b>A:</b> The brakes need to be replaced, as well as the power steering.<br> <b>B:</b> Is that all? That seems like an easy fix.<br> <b>A:</b> That's not all. The alternator seems to be malfunctioning.<br> <b>B:</b> How much would it cost me to fix it all?<br> <b>A:</b> It'll cost around $300 to $400.<br> <b>B:</b> That's not too bad. Is there anything else?<br> <b>A:</b> From what I can tell, no. I would recommend buying it.<br> <b>B:</b> Let me call the seller, and I will let you know if you can start.<br> <b>A:</b> Great. I can start right away, if he gives you the thumbs up.<br> <b>B:</b> He said that it's fine. I will be back for the car when you're done.  </p>
