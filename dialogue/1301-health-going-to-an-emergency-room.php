				<h2>Going to an Emergency Room</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> Sorry to bother you, but I was wondering if you could drive me to the  	emergency room.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Of course. What is the problem?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am running a really high fever of 105 degrees, and I have a rash on my  	stomach.<br> 	<b>B:</b> If you can, go and unlock the back door, so I can get in when I get there  	if you fall asleep.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I can do that when I get off of the phone.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you know where your driver's license and insurance card are?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I already had them out before I called you.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Where is your nearest emergency room?<br> 	<b>A:</b> It's just a few blocks away.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Fine, I am on my way. I'll be there in about five minutes.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I hate to call you this late at night, but could you possibly help me  	get to the emergency room?<br> 	<b>B:</b> We will come right over. What happened?<br> 	<b>A:</b> My temperature went up to 105, and I have a rash!<br> 	<b>B:</b> Make sure that someone unlocks the back door, so I can get in if you fall  	asleep before I get there.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I will do that in a minute.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Make sure that you have your insurance card and driver's license where we  	can grab them.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I know right where they both are.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Is there an emergency room near you?<br> 	<b>A:</b> It is on the other side of town, next to city hall.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am on my way. Give me ten minutes and I'll get to you.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> I really need your help and want to know if you could drive me to the  	emergency room.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will take you there right away. What is wrong?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I woke up with a rash and a temperature of 105!<br> 	<b>B:</b> I want to be able to get to you when I get there. If you can unlock the  	back door right now, that would be great.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I will make sure that I do that before you get here.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Also, make sure that we have your driver's license and insurance card  	before we leave for the emergency room.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am getting them out while I am speaking to you.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Do you know where your nearest emergency room is?<br> 	<b>A:</b> It is near the bridge that crosses over the river.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am driving to you even as we speak. Hang in there!<br>
