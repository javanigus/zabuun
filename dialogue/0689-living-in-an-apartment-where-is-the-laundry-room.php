				<h2>Where Is the Laundry Room</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hello, neighbor. I just moved into the apartments last week. I have a  question.<br> <b>B:</b> Sure. What do you need to know?<br> <b>A:</b> I need to locate the laundry room. I have a load of clothes to wash.<br> <b>B:</b> There is one downstairs.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you very much.<br> <b>B:</b> There is also another located in the basement of the neighboring building.<br> <b>A:</b> Do I have to pay at a front desk?<br> <b>B:</b> No, the machines require exact change. I suggest you take quarters.<br> <b>A:</b> Does the laundry room carry detergent?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, but I recommend you take your own. They're expensive.<br> <b>A:</b> That's good to know. Thanks again and have a nice day.<br> <b>B:</b> No problem. See you around.  </p>
