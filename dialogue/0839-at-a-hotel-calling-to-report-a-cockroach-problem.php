				<h2>Calling to Report a Cockroach Problem (2)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> There're a few problems with room 217, and I'd liked to be moved.<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe it's a problem we can fix without moving you.<br> <b>A:</b> If you can kill the 8 cockroaches I've seen this morning.<br> <b>B:</b> Did you say 8 cockroaches? Are you exaggerating just a little?<br> <b>A:</b> I know how to count and I took pictures and video with my cell phone.<br> <b>B:</b> We can call an exterminator and send him to your room.<br> <b>A:</b> Great, and then I'm supposed to breathe in toxins after that?<br> <b>B:</b> At least you won't have any more roaches.<br> <b>A:</b> You can't be serious right now. Can I speak to your supervisor?<br> <b>B:</b> I can transfer your call right now.<br> <b>A:</b> Can you also transfer my room?<br> <b>B:</b> I'll check to see if we have any vacant rooms we can move you to.  </p>
