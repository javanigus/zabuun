				<h2>Fighting a Ticket in Court (1)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Your Honour, I'd like to challenge this ticket.<br> <b>B:</b> What is your reason for challenging this ticket?<br> <b>A:</b> The police officer did not have the right to issue the ticket.<br> <b>B:</b> Can you explain what you mean with that statement?<br> <b>A:</b> I was rightfully parked. He told me that I was parked in a handicap space. <br> <b>B:</b> Well, was it a handicap space?<br> <b>A:</b> It used to be. It is not anymore.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, was there a sign letting you know it was a handicap space?<br> <b>A:</b> No, because the spot has since been removed.<br> <b>B:</b> So, did you explain to the officer that it was no longer a handicap space.<br> <b>A:</b> I tried, but he wouldn't listen. He said I was trying to get away from  paying.<br> <b>B:</b> Thank you. I will question the officer, and get his side of the story.  </p>
