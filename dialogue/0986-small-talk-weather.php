				  <b>A:</b> I really want to go to the beach this weekend.<br> <b>B:</b> That sounds like fun. What's the weather going to be like?<br> <b>A:</b> I heard that it's going to be warm this weekend.<br> <b>B:</b> Is it going to be perfect beach weather?<br> <b>A:</b> I believe so.<br> <b>B:</b> Good. I hope it doesn't cool off this weekend.<br> <b>A:</b> I know. I really want to go to the beach.<br> <b>B:</b> But you know that California weather is really unpredictable.<br> <b>A:</b> You're right. One minute it's hot, and then the next minute it's cold.<br> <b>B:</b> I really wish the weather would just stay the same.<br> <b>A:</b> I do too. That way we can have our activities planned ahead of time.<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah, that would make things a lot easier.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.<br> <b>B:</b> A trip to the beach would be fun. How is the weather going to be?<br> <b>A:</b> The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.<br> <b>B:</b> So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?<br> <b>A:</b> It sounds like it will be.<br> <b>B:</b> I really hope it doesn't get cold.<br> <b>A:</b> That would ruin things, I want to go so badly.<br> <b>B:</b> The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know.<br> <b>A:</b> That is true. The weather is constantly changing.<br> <b>B:</b> It would be nice if the weather would never change.<br> <b>A:</b> That would be great, then we could plan things sooner.<br> <b>B:</b> True. Predictable weather would make life easier.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> It would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.<br> <b>B:</b> What's the weather going to be like? I may want to go too.<br> <b>A:</b> The weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.<br> <b>B:</b> Will it be good beach weather?<br> <b>A:</b> I think it will be.<br> <b>B:</b> It wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.<br> <b>A:</b> I want this trip to be perfect, I hope it stays warm.<br> <b>B:</b> This California weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll  happen.<br> <b>A:</b> I know. Every day the weather seems different.<br> <b>B:</b> I would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.<br> <b>A:</b> That would make it easier for us to make plans.<br> <b>B:</b> I know. Things are easier when you know what the weather's going to be like.<br>
