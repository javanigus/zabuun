It's late.<br> <b>B:</b> Sorry to tell you, your payment didn't come today.<br> <b>A:</b> No way. Darn it! It's more than a week late!<br> <b>B:</b> Why don't you call EDD? I think they can tell you where it is.<br> <b>A:</b> I definitely need to call them.<br> <b>B:</b> I think it's an automated system.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh darn. I don't like automated systems.<br> <b>B:</b> The EDD system is not so bad.<br> <b>A:</b> Okay, I'll call. This is the longest the check has taken to get to me.<br> <b>B:</b> If you have problems with the system, you can speak to a person by dialing "0".  </p>
