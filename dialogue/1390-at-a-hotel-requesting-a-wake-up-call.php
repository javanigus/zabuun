				<h2>Requesting a Wake-Up Call</h2>
				    <b>A:</b> I need to request a wake-up call for tomorrow morning.<br>   <b>B:</b> What time do you want the call?<br>   <b>A:</b> I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.<br>   <b>B:</b> We can certainly do that. Expect a call from us at 7:00, and then again at    7:15.<br>   <b>A:</b> Actually, can I change the latter wake-up call to 7:30 am?<br>   <b>B:</b> I can certainly do that. Is there anything else?<br>   <b>A:</b> I can't think of anything. If I do think of something, I'll be sure to call    again.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay. Good night, sir.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I need a wake-up call tomorrow morning.<br>   <b>B:</b> Of course. When would you like the call?<br>   <b>A:</b> Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.<br>   <b>B:</b> No problem. We'll give you both calls.<br>   <b>A:</b> Do you know what, let's change the second call to 7:30.<br>   <b>B:</b> No problem. Anything else, sir?<br>   <b>A:</b> Not at the moment, thank you.<br>   <b>B:</b> Let me know if you do need anything.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> Can you give me a wake-up call tomorrow?<br>   <b>B:</b> Certainly. What time would you like us to call you?<br>   <b>A:</b> I need two wake-up calls, if you don't mind, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.<br>   <b>B:</b> Not a problem. We'll call you tomorrow morning at 7, and again at 7:15.<br>   <b>A:</b> On second thought, you'd better make that second call at 7:30 instead of    7:15.<br>   <b>B:</b> Said, and done. Will there be anything else?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, that gets it for now, thank you.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, give us a call if there's anything more we can help you with.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> Tomorrow I'm going to need a wake-up call.<br>   <b>B:</b> Not a problem. What time shall we call you?<br>   <b>A:</b> I always hit the snooze button, so give me two calls, one at 7 and another    at 7:15.<br>   <b>B:</b> It'll be our pleasure. We'll call you at 7 and then at 7:15.<br>   <b>A:</b> Oops, cancel that. Change the second call to 7:30, will you, please?<br>   <b>B:</b> No sooner said than done. Can I help you with anything else?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, that's about it for now.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay, sir. Have a pleasant evening.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I need a wake-up call tomorrow.<br>   <b>B:</b> What time would you like your wake-up call?<br>   <b>A:</b> I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7:15.<br>   <b>B:</b> That is no problem at all, of course. You'll get a call at 7:00, and    another at 7:15.<br>   <b>A:</b> Then again, I think 7:15 is too early. Change 7:15 to 7:30, please.<br>   <b>B:</b> So, that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7:30. Do you have any other    requests?<br>   <b>A:</b> Not just now, but if I do think of something later, I'll give you a ring.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay, sir. Sleep well.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I've got to get up early tomorrow, so please give me a wake-up call.<br>   <b>B:</b> Of course. We can give you a call anytime you like.<br>   <b>A:</b> Actually, I need two calls, one at 7 and the other at 7:15.<br>   <b>B:</b> Your wish is our command. Expect a call at 7, and another one at 7:15. <br>   <b>A:</b> Wait a minute! I don't like 7:15, now that I think about it. Change it to    7:30.<br>   <b>B:</b> The second call is now changed to 7:30. Is there anything else we can help    you with?<br>   <b>A:</b> Nothing that I can think of right now. If something comes up, though, I'll    call you.<br>   <b>B:</b> We're here all night long if you need anything.<br>
