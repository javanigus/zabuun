				<p>  <b>A:</b> This is a great apartment.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm glad you found it to your liking.<br> <b>A:</b> I knew I would, judging from the description I read.<br> <b>B:</b> Are you ready to discuss payment?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I think I am.<br> <b>B:</b> You will have to pay for the security deposit.<br> <b>A:</b> Security deposit? What is that for?<br> <b>B:</b> It's simply money you give to me as a kind of insurance in case you cause any damage to the apartment.<br> <b>A:</b> I understand. That makes sense.<br> <b>B:</b> So are you ready to pay the deposit?<br> <b>A:</b> How much are you asking?<br> <b>B:</b> It's at least $1,000 for the security deposit.<br> <b>A:</b> Alright, I could provide that much.<br> <b>B:</b> Perfect! I think we are ready to sign the lease.  </p>
