				<h2>Marketing the House</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> It's time to start thinking about marketing our home.<br> <b>B:</b> Won't our realtor do that?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, of course, but we can make some suggestions.<br> <b>B:</b> What suggestions?<br> <b>A:</b> I definitely want to have a "For Sale" sign on the lawn.<br> <b>B:</b> That's funny. Don't all houses for sale have that?<br> <b>A:</b> No, not really. A lot of homes are just listed on the Internet.<br> <b>B:</b> why do you want the sign then?<br> <b>A:</b> I still think it is an effective tool in selling a house.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, you're the boss.<br> <b>A:</b> We'll also have a listing online, so we can reach more people.<br> <b>B:</b> Sounds good to me. We should do well then.  </p>
