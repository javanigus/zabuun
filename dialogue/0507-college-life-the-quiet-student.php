				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hi, I'm James. What's your name?<br> <b>B:</b> Hi James. My name is Lisa.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm taking this class because it seems interesting. Why are you?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm taking this class because it's a requirement.<br> <b>A:</b> We should get to know each other.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't think so. I like keeping to myself.<br> <b>A:</b> So you don't like meeting new students?<br> <b>B:</b> Nope. I would rather just be alone.<br> <b>A:</b> That is so sad!<br> <b>B:</b> It's not. It's really peaceful and self-empowering.<br> <b>A:</b> Can we at least study together?<br> <b>B:</b> Nope, we can't do that.  </p>
