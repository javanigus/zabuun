				<p>  <b>A:</b> Thank you for coming in today. I'll see you next week.<br> <b>B:</b> Excuse me, instructor. May I speak with you for a moment?<br> <b>A:</b> Sure thing, Mr. Davis. What can I help you with?<br> <b>B:</b> Well, about next week. I can't make it.<br> <b>A:</b> That is a problem. You are mandated by court to attend every week.<br> <b>B:</b> I know, but I have a family emergency.<br> <b>A:</b> You have to go to the court and ask for an extension.<br> <b>B:</b> Do I have to come back over here after?<br> <b>A:</b> No, they will give you a make-up date.<br> <b>B:</b> Great. Thank you for all your help.<br> <b>A:</b> Sure thing. I hope everything is alright.<br> <b>B:</b> Thanks. I'll see you next time.  </p>
