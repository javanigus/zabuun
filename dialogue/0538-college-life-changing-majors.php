				<h2>Changing Majors</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I was wondering if I could change my major from biology to political  science.<br> <b>B:</b> Those majors are very different from each other.<br> <b>A:</b> I know, but I hate biology. I can't see myself studying it anymore.<br> <b>B:</b> You can change it, but you'll have to take more classes.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't mind. Political science is really interesting to me.<br> <b>B:</b> You would be graduating a year late.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, no. I have to think a little more about this then.<br> <b>B:</b> I think you should change it, since you hate biology.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry I am so indecisive.<br> <b>B:</b> A lot of people change majors. It's normal.<br> <b>A:</b> But not as late as I did. I hate that I'm graduating after all my friends.<br> <b>B:</b> You're making the right choice.  </p>
