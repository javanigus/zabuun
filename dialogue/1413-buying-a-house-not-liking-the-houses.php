				<h1>Buying a House</h1>
				<h2>Not Liking the Houses</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> I am not sure I even want to look at this house!<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is a bit of a fixer-upper. Let's take a look inside.<br> 	<b>A:</b> It doesn't look much better inside this place.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You know, with a little elbow grease and paint, you could spruce it up a  	bit.<br> 	<b>A:</b> There are hardly any windows in here, and that makes it really gloomy.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Let's go check out the kitchen. The printout says that it is quite large.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities. Follow me, please.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What's that smell?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Perhaps we should move on to the next listing.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> This house is not looking all that great from here<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can't really tell everything about a house from the outside. Let's go  	inside.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I don't think that it is looking any better inside here.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better.<br> 	<b>A:</b> It is just too dark in here with so few windows.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I hear that the kitchen is quite large. Let's go check it out.<br> 	<b>A:</b> The kitchen may be large, but it doesn't have any storage space.<br> 	<b>B:</b> The master suite is supposed to be quite elegant. Maybe it will be a  	little better.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How many dogs live in this house?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think that we have seen all that we need to see here. Let's go look at  	another house.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> From the looks of this house from the outside, I don't really think that  	I want to go inside.<br> 	<b>B:</b> From here, it does look like it could use a little work. Let's see what  	the interior looks like.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am not impressed by the interior of this house.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh  	paint.<br> 	<b>A:</b> With so few windows, how can you even see what the problems are?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think that we should check out the kitchen. It is listed as roomy and  	spacious.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite. I think that we  	should go look at it since we are here.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Is there a dead animal somewhere in here?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Well, I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house  	for you.<br>
