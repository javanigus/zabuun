				<h2>Talking to a Seatmate</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Do you hate flying as much as I do?<br> <b>B:</b> Only when I have chatty seatmates.<br> <b>A:</b> You look like a business traveler, am I right?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm in sales, but please excuse me. I have a lot of work to do.<br> <b>A:</b> Is that computer connected to the airplane wi-fi network?<br> <b>B:</b> It is, so I can send work to my office even when travelling.<br> <b>A:</b> I hope they pay you really well.<br> <b>B:</b> That's really none of your business.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you have a company credit card?<br> <b>B:</b> I do because I travel so much.<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe you can buy me a drink since all I have is cash.<br> <b>B:</b> I can only pay for business expenses, not alcohol.  </p>
