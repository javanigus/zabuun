				<h1>Renting an Apartment</h1>
				<h2>A Broken Window</h2>
				    <b>A:</b> This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. Can I speak to the apartment manager?<br>   <b>B:</b> Hi. How can I help you today?<br>   <b>A:</b> Well, my window facing the empty lot is broken.<br>   <b>B:</b> Oh, that's not good. What happened?<br>   <b>A:</b> I dont know. I wasn't home when it happened.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you have any clue who might have done this?<br>   <b>A:</b> I have a feeling that it might have been the neighborhood kids.<br>   <b>B:</b> Why, what leads you to that suspicion?<br>   <b>A:</b> Well, next to the broken glass was a baseball.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, a baseball is certainly solid evidence.<br>   <b>A:</b> I saw them playing just before I left my apartment.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, did you recognize any of them?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, I just took a quick look.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, it'll take a couple of days to repair it.<br>   <b>A:</b> A friend of mine is in the business. How about if I call him?<br>   <b>B:</b> That's okay by me. First, let me come see the damage.<br>   <b>A:</b> Come on over. So does my friend charge you or me?<br>   <b>B:</b> Since you didn't break it, you don't have to pay for it.<br>   <b>A:</b> That's a relief. I thought I was going to get stuck with the bill.<br>   <b>B:</b> If I knew which kid did it, I would bill his parents.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> I'm Janet Smith in apartment 23. Is this the apartment manager?<br>   <b>B:</b> Hello. What can I do for you today?<br>   <b>A:</b> My living room window is broken.<br>   <b>B:</b> Are you serious? Do you know what happened?<br>   <b>A:</b> I am not really sure, because I was out when it occurred.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you have any idea who might have been behind this?<br>   <b>A:</b> Something tells me it might be some of the kids in the complex.<br>   <b>B:</b> What led you to think it might be the kids in this building?<br>   <b>A:</b> I found a baseball near the broken glass.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, you can't ignore a baseball in your living room, can you?<br>   <b>A:</b> I saw them in the lot just before I went out.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you know any of them?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, I didn't pay any attention to who they were.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'll call the window repairman, but it'll probably take a couple of days.<br>   <b>A:</b> I could get fast service if I call a friend of mine.<br>   <b>B:</b> I don't have a problem with that. Let me look at the damage first.<br>   <b>A:</b> Okay, I'm waiting for you. But who does my friend give the bill to?<br>   <b>B:</b> Since the kids broke it, your friend can bill me.<br>   <b>A:</b> Whew! I was worried that I would have to pay for it.<br>   <b>B:</b> Believe me, if I find out which kid broke the window, I'll bill his    parents.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> This is Janet Smith in apartment 23. May I speak to the apartment manager?<br>   <b>B:</b> Speaking. What can I do for you?<br>   <b>A:</b> Something happened to my window. It's broken.<br>   <b>B:</b> That doesn't sound good. Do you know how it happened?<br>   <b>A:</b> I don't know the exact details.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you have an idea who might be responsible for the window?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm almost sure it is the local kids in the apartments.<br>   <b>B:</b> How did you come to that conclusion?<br>   <b>A:</b> There was a baseball in my living room along with the broken glass.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, at least there's no mystery about how it happened.<br>   <b>A:</b> I saw a group of them playing in the lot just before I went out to my car.<br>   <b>B:</b> Can you tell me which ones you recognized?<br>   <b>A:</b> I just looked at them for a second.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'll call a repairman, but it might take two days.<br>   <b>A:</b> How about if I call a friend of mine who is a repairman?<br>   <b>B:</b> That's no problem. I'll come by right now to look at the damage.<br>   <b>A:</b> Okay. Come on over. But tell me, who pays for this?<br>   <b>B:</b> You can pay for it, and I can reimburse you. Or he can bill me directly.<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm glad to hear that. I didn't want to get stuck with the bill.<br>   <b>B:</b> I will bill the kid's parents if I ever find out which kid did it.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hello, I'm John Smith in unit 23. Am I speaking to the apartment manager?<br>   <b>B:</b> This is he. How may I help you?<br>   <b>A:</b> My window that faces the empty lot is broken.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm sorry to hear that. Why is it broken?<br>   <b>A:</b> I can't tell you exactly how it happened.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, tell me what you think might have happened.<br>   <b>A:</b> I've got a pretty good idea that it's the kids who live here.<br>   <b>B:</b> Why do you think that?<br>   <b>A:</b> Next to the broken glass in my living room was a baseball.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, you don't need Sherlock Holmes to figure this one out, do you?<br>   <b>A:</b> Just before I went shopping, I saw them in the lot.<br>   <b>B:</b> Can you give me a name or two, or a description?<br>   <b>A:</b> I have absolutely no idea.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'll call a repairman for you, but it'll probably take one or two days.<br>   <b>A:</b> I could probably get it fixed today, because a friend of mine is a    repairman.<br>   <b>B:</b> That's okay. But let me see the damage first. I'm coming over.<br>   <b>A:</b> The glass is all cleaned up, so come on over. But do I pay for this?<br>   <b>B:</b> No. I will pay your friend, or I will reimburse you if you pay him.<br>   <b>A:</b> That's good news. I was worried you were going to make me pay for this.<br>   <b>B:</b> You're not at fault. But the kid who did it is.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> This is John Smith in unit 23. Is this the apartment manager?<br>   <b>B:</b> Hi. What do you need today?<br>   <b>A:</b> I've got a broken living room window.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm sorry about that. How did it get broken?<br>   <b>A:</b> I've got a good idea, but I'm not exactly sure.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, why don't you give me a few details?<br>   <b>A:</b> I would bet a dollar to a dime that it's one of the local kids.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you have any support for that charge?<br>   <b>A:</b> A baseball was on my living room carpet. I don't own a baseball.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, it sounds like someone hit a home run.<br>   <b>A:</b> I saw them playing ball in the lot just before I went to the market.<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you know for sure who they were?<br>   <b>A:</b> All I did was glance at them before I left.<br>   <b>B:</b> If you like, I'll call a repairman, but it might take a few days.<br>   <b>A:</b> How about if I call my friend? He's a repairman and could probably fix it    today.<br>   <b>B:</b> Sure. Let me come over to see the damage right now, though.<br>   <b>A:</b> Sure, come on over, but tell me, do I have to pay for this?<br>   <b>B:</b> You're not responsible, so you don't pay. Tell him to bill me.<br>   <b>A:</b> Well, lucky me. I was afraid that I was going to get stuck for the bill.<br>   <b>B:</b> Maybe I'll install a camera on that end of the building to catch these    kids.<br>
