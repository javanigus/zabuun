It's one of my favorites.<br> <b>B:</b> That's good to know.<br> <b>A:</b> You should check out more books.<br> <b>B:</b> I can check out more than one?<br> <b>A:</b> Of course! It would be crazy if you could only get one book.<br> <b>B:</b> That's awesome! I'll be back.<br> <b>A:</b> Don't go crazy now. The limit is 15 books.<br> <b>B:</b> Don't worry. I'll probably come back with 5 more books.<br> <b>A:</b> It's great to see a kid excited about reading.<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah, most kids hate reading. They're more into television.  </p>
