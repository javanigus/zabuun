Congratulations, but why is that so exciting for you?<br> <b>A:</b> Are you kidding? I just played a role in history.<br> <b>B:</b> What if the incumbent wins?<br> <b>A:</b> Still, participating in U.S. democracy is great.<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe because I've done it so many times, and it doesn't seem like a big deal to me.<br> <b>A:</b> I can't wait to vote again next election.<br> <b>B:</b> Not everyone votes, so it's good that you take it seriously.<br> <b>A:</b> Everyone should take it seriously.<br> <b>B:</b> You're a great example.  </p>
