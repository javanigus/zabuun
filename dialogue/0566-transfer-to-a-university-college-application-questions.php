				<p>  <b>A:</b> What are you doing?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm filling out my college application.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you need any help? I applied two years ago.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I do need help. Should I put my ethnicity?<br> <b>A:</b> It won't be used for or against you. It's really up to you.<br> <b>B:</b> Also, should I put all of my extracurriculars?<br> <b>A:</b> Put the ones that you were heavily involved in.<br> <b>B:</b> Next question, should I put anything in the "additional information" section?<br> <b>A:</b> If you feel like you need to say something that you didn't mention before,  then yes.<br> <b>B:</b> Can I say I got an A when I really just got a B? <br> <b>A:</b> What?! Of course not! They will ask for your transcript.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, I didn't know that.  </p>
