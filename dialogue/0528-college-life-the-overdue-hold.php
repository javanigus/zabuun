				<h2>The Overdue Hold</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Wow! Your books are over the due date by one month.<br> <b>B:</b> It would have been longer if there wasn't a hold on my record.<br> <b>A:</b> What kind of hold is on your record?<br> <b>B:</b> A hold that won't let me go to the college football game.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, that's tough.<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah. My girlfriend is actually a cheerleader, and so I have to go.<br> <b>A:</b> You're not going to like what I'm going to say.<br> <b>B:</b> What is it?<br> <b>A:</b> I can't remove the hold even if you pay the overdue fee.<br> <b>B:</b> Is it a technical error?<br> <b>A:</b> I don't know! I just can't remove it!<br> <b>B:</b> If my girlfriend breaks up with me, I'm blaming you.  </p>
