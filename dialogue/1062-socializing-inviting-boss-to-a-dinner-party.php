				<h2>Inviting Boss to a Dinner Party</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Mr. Lee, I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for  next Friday night?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I think we might be free. What did you have in mind?<br> <b>A:</b> I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner  party at my home.<br> <b>B:</b> That sounds great. Is it casual?<br> <b>A:</b> Actually, we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the  holidays.<br> <b>B:</b> That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, we've invited four other couples, so it should be a good mix of people.<br> <b>B:</b> That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know?<br> <b>A:</b> Oh yes, everyone we are inviting is from our company.<br> <b>B:</b> Great! I'll look forward to it. We'll make sure and check the mail for our  invitation.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Mr. Lee, would you and your wife be free next Friday night?<br> <b>B:</b> I don't think we have any plans, but I would need to see what my wife has  planned. Why?<br> <b>A:</b> My wife mailed a written invitation to your wife asking you both to our  dinner party.<br> <b>B:</b> It would be our pleasure to join you for dinner. What type of party is it?<br> <b>A:</b> We've always wanted to have a formal dinner party.<br> <b>B:</b> I think we would enjoy that, especially our wives!<br> <b>A:</b> Four other couples are coming, so I'm hoping for some interesting  conversation.<br> <b>B:</b> I am sure we will have a great time. Will some of the couples be from our  company?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, you will know all of our guests.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll make sure to check the mail for our invitation. Your dinner plans sound  wonderful.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Would you and your wife be available next Friday night, Mr.  Lee?<br> <b>B:</b> I'll have to check with my wife, of course. Did you have something planned?<br> <b>A:</b> We are having a dinner party, and my wife sent you and your wife an  invitation.<br> <b>B:</b> I think we would enjoy that. Is it a formal affair?<br> <b>A:</b> My wife insisted on having it be a formal dinner party this time.<br> <b>B:</b> That would be a change. Usually we just do barbeques and never get a chance  to dress up.<br> <b>A:</b> We thought that inviting four other couples would make nice conversation.<br> <b>B:</b> I think we will enjoy being there. Will we know anyone?<br> <b>A:</b> We are only inviting people from work.<br> <b>B:</b> I am sure that a good time will be had by everyone. We will be looking for  your invitation.<br>
