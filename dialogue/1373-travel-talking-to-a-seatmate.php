				<h2>Talking to a Seatmate</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> That rain is really coming down out there!<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, it's kind of crazy weather outside.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I get kind of nervous flying in this kind of weather.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I don't think anyone feels all that comfortable flying in a storm.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you think it will be this bad the whole trip?<br> 	<b>B:</b> On the weather channel, this storm looked to be a big one. It will  	probably be with us for a while.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I worry about too much ice on the wings.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I have to believe that our pilot knows what he is doing and we'll be  	okay.<br> 	<b>A:</b> When do you think the pilot will turn off the Fasten Your Seatbelt sign?<br> 	<b>B:</b> He'll turn it off as soon as he knows that we are through the turbulence.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you think that we are going to crash?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Maybe. You just never know.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> It sure is windy out there!<br> 	<b>B:</b> It definitely is not the perfect day to fly, is it?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am scared of flying to begin with, but bad weather makes it a little  	worse.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Anyone who actually enjoys flying in bad weather is out of their mind.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Will the whole flight be this bad?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think that it will probably let up once we get out of here. Let's cross  	our fingers!<br> 	<b>A:</b> What if we hit a flock of birds?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Plane crashes are very rare. We'll be fine.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you think that the pilot will ever turn off the Fasten Your Seatbelt  	sign?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The pilot needs to make sure that there is no more turbulence before he  	lets us get up.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you think that we are going to die?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Can I buy you an alcoholic beverage?<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> I can't believe how bad the weather is today!<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, according to the weather report, we will be flying through a pretty  	nasty storm.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I don't really like flying in this kind of weather.<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is normal to feel a little nervous about flying in bad weather.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How long do you think this will last?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Usually the pilot can get enough altitude to get above it. I hope that  	happens this time!<br> 	<b>A:</b> What if one of the engines stops working?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I trust that the airline wouldn't let us take off without feeling that  	all was okay.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How much longer do you think that the pilot will leave the Fasten Your  	Seatbelt sign on?<br> 	<b>B:</b> When we are past the turbulence, I am sure that the pilot will shut the  	light off.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you think we are headed for an air disaster?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Would you like a pillow and blanket so you can take a nap?<br>
