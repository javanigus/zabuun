				<h2>Reserving a Book</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I would like to reserve The Hunger Games. <br> <b>B:</b> Everyone wants to reserve that book these days.<br> <b>A:</b> It's really popular, because the movie just came out.<br> <b>B:</b> You have to pay $1 to reserve the book.<br> <b>A:</b> What?! That's ridiculous.<br> <b>B:</b> Like you said, it's popular.<br> <b>A:</b> I have to think about it then.<br> <b>B:</b> I personally think $1 is nothing. It's cheaper than buying the book.<br> <b>A:</b> How much is the book?<br> <b>B:</b> On the back, it says it's $15. It depends on the bookstore you go to though.<br> <b>A:</b> Fine, I'll give you a $1.<br> <b>B:</b> You won't regret it! The book is really good.  </p>
