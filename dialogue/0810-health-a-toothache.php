				<h2>A Toothache</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Why are you holding your mouth?<br> <b>B:</b> I think I cracked a tooth. It hurts so much.<br> <b>A:</b> Did you look in the mirror?<br> <b>B:</b> No, but I can feel a sharp pain when my tongue touches my molars.<br> <b>A:</b> That sort of thing can be infected easily.<br> <b>B:</b> So what should I do?<br> <b>A:</b> You should find an emergency dentist.<br> <b>B:</b> That is going to cost so much money.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, but it's better than being in pain.<br> <b>B:</b> Do you think they'll have to pull the tooth?<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe they just have to seal it up.<br> <b>B:</b> Get me the yellow pages so I can find a nearby emergency dentist.  </p>
