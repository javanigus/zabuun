				<h2>Do not Like the House (1)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I think this house will fill all you needs, Mr. Jones.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, I don't particularly like the neighborhood.<br> <b>A:</b> I understand your concern, Mr. Jones, but let's take a look inside.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, but I'm really concerned about the neighborhood.<br> <b>A:</b> That's okay, Mr. Jones. We're not married to this home.<br> <b>B:</b> I guess we can look inside since we're here.<br> <b>A:</b> Great! Let's go inside. It's a beautiful home.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't like it already. The porch is too small. I have a big family.<br> <b>A:</b> All right, Mr. Jones. This may not be the right house for you.<br> <b>B:</b> That's what I've been trying to tell you.<br> <b>A:</b> That's okay. I've got more homes to show you.<br> <b>B:</b> That's good to hear.  </p>
