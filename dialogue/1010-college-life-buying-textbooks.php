				<h2>Buying Textbooks</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> How do I buy my textbooks?<br> <b>B:</b> Do you have your book list for your class?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I have my list.<br> <b>B:</b> Fine. Once you have it, you can go to the bookstore. Do you know where that  is?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I know where the bookstore is.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, so once you pass the gym, it's the first door on your left. Do you know  you can also sell your used textbooks there? <br> <b>A:</b> No, I didn't know I could do that.<br> <b>B:</b> You just take them with you and trade them with the used textbook man just  outside the door. Do you think you will be doing that today?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I am going today.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, if you decide to go, I could meet you over there at 1:00 today or  tomorrow to help you. Would that work for you?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, thank you. That would be great.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, then, I'll talk to you later.

Can you find  it?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I don't know where the bookstore is.<br> <b>B:</b> Just pass the gym and it's the first door on your left. Were you aware that  you can also turn in your old textbooks for money?<br> <b>A:</b> Really? How can I do that?<br> <b>B:</b> Take your used textbooks with you and give them to the representative near  the entrance. He will pay you for them. Are you going today?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I can't make it today.<br> <b>B:</b> I could help you with buying your books if you meet me there at 1:00 today or  tomorrow.
