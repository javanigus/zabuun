				<h2>How to Buy a Pass (1)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I have so many places to go today.<br> <b>B:</b> Are you planning on taking the bus?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes. I'm going to have to bring so much bus fare with me.<br> <b>B:</b> You don't have to. Just buy a pass for the day.<br> <b>A:</b> A pass? What's that?<br> <b>B:</b> It comes in the form of a card that allows you to pass on any bus.<br> <b>A:</b> And is it just for one day?<br> <b>B:</b> You can buy a bus pass for the day, week, month, and even a year.<br> <b>A:</b> I didn't know that. How do I buy one?<br> <b>B:</b> You can ask for one on the bus.<br> <b>A:</b> How much does the card cost?<br> <b>B:</b> The card itself is one dollar, but a pass for the day is five.<br> <b>A:</b> I only need to bring six dollars with me today?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. Unless you want to buy a pass for a week or longer.  </p>
