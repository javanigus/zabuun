				<h2>Trash and Recycling (1)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Why do you have so many full trash bags?<br> <b>B:</b> I had a party last night. I'm cleaning up now and tossing them away.<br> <b>A:</b> Wait! What are you doing?<br> <b>B:</b> Throwing these bags into the trash can. Why do you seem concerned?<br> <b>A:</b> Did you divide the recyclables from the trash?<br> <b>B:</b> No, I didn't. I was a bit lazy to do so.<br> <b>A:</b> Don't be lazy. You should do your part in helping the environment.<br> <b>B:</b> You're right. It's going to be messy though. Mind giving me a hand?<br> <b>A:</b> Sure. I'd be glad to.<br> <b>B:</b> Thank you. This is a lot to handle alone.<br> <b>A:</b> Don't mention it. After all, one person can make a big difference to the  environment.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll be sure to be more considerate next time.  </p>
