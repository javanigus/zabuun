				<p>  <b>A:</b> The police need our help finding a robber.<br> <b>B:</b> How do you know?<br> <b>A:</b> The TV news is reporting a bank robbery.<br> <b>B:</b> Do they know what the robber looks like?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, he's 6 feet tall, 200 pounds, black hair, and about 30 years old.<br> <b>B:</b> What race is he?<br> <b>A:</b> They didn't say.<br> <b>B:</b> The TV news doesn't tell us the race anymore.<br> <b>A:</b> Of course not. That would be racist.<br> <b>B:</b> But how can we identify someone if we don't know their race?<br> <b>A:</b> Don't ask me.<br> <b>B:</b> Then they also shouldn't tell us if the robber is male or female, because that is sexist.  </p>
