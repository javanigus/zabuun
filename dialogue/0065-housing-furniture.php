				<p>  <b>A:</b> I repainted my house, so I need some new furniture.<br> <b>B:</b> What pieces are you looking for?<br> <b>A:</b> A new table, a sofa, and maybe a reading chair.<br> <b>B:</b> What's wrong with your old furniture?<br> <b>A:</b> It doesn't match the room anymore.<br> <b>B:</b> Is it still comfortable to use?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes. I think I will sell it.<br> <b>B:</b> You can also get it re-upholstered.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you crazy? That is much too expensive!<br> <b>B:</b> It depends on where you have it done.<br> <b>A:</b> I still say that takes too much effort.<br> <b>B:</b> Trying to help you takes too much effort, too.  </p>
