				<h2>Complaining about a Tour</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> I am having some big problems on this tour.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What seems to be the problem? We are here to help you.<br> 	<b>A:</b> This tour company seems very disorganized. No one seems to have a clear  	picture as to where we are going and when we are going to get there.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will see what I can do about that. How about the accommodations on the  	tour?<br> 	<b>A:</b> So far, we have been staying in really out-of-the-way accommodations.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Is anything wrong with your room?<br> 	<b>A:</b> The television in our room was broken, and they didn't send anyone to fix  	it.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will complain to the hotel manager about that. How about the hotel  	restaurant?<br> 	<b>A:</b> The food in the restaurant was terrible, and a few people from our group  	got sick.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am so sorry that you had such a bad experience. We would like to offer  	you a free city tour and lunch to make it up to you.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I paid good money for this tour and would appreciate some help with some  	problems that have come up.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I would like to help you smooth out any difficulties you are having. What  	can I help you with?<br> 	<b>A:</b> This tour company can't seem to coordinate anything. We are always  	arriving after something is closed or get there when the guides for the site  	are on a break.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We are trying to fix that. Are the accommodations to your liking?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Our accommodations are pretty substandard.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Is there anything in particular that is wrong with your room?<br> 	<b>A:</b> The room smelled of smoke, even though it was supposed to be a nonsmoking  	room.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You should not have to put up with that. Was the hotel restaurant good?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Actually a few people from our group got sick, and everyone thinks it was  	from the bad dinner that we ate.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Our tour company takes pride in providing excellent tours. Please let me  	offer you a free city tour and lunch as an apology.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I would like to discuss some problems that I am having with this tour.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am sorry you are having a difficult time. What may I help you with?<br> 	<b>A:</b> This tour company doesn't seem to know the town very well. We are always  	getting lost!<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am sorry that that has been the case. How would you rate your  	accommodations?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Our accommodations are not very pleasant.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What don't you like about your room?<br> 	<b>A:</b> The room was very noisy, and we couldn't get to sleep.<br> 	<b>B:</b> That is unacceptable. Did you at least enjoy your dinner in the hotel  	restaurant?<br> 	<b>A:</b> The food was horrible at the hotel restaurant, and a few of us got sick  	after eating there.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am glad that you told me about the problems. I would like you to be my  	guest for a free massage at the hotel spa tonight.<br>
