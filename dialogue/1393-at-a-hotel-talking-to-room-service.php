				<h1>At a Hotel</h1>
				<h2>Talking to Room Service</h2>
				    <b>A:</b> I'd like to order dinner.<br>   <b>B:</b> What would you like?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'd like to order a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm sorry. We're currently out of filet mignon. May I suggest the    porterhouse instead?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'd prefer the filet, but the porterhouse will do.<br>   <b>B:</b> And may I suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?<br>   <b>A:</b> Normally, I would take you up on that suggestion, but just the champagne    will do for tonight.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay, no strawberries. Room service will be charged to your amenities    account. Is that all right?<br>   <b>A:</b> That's fine.<br>   <b>B:</b> It will be up shortly. Enjoy your food, sir.<br>  <hr>            <b>A:</b> Could I order dinner?<br>   <b>B:</b> Of course. What would you like?<br>   <b>A:</b> I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm so sorry. We ran out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse    instead?<br>   <b>A:</b> That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay.<br>   <b>B:</b> May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the    champagne?<br>   <b>A:</b> Not tonight, thank you.<br>   <b>B:</b> No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay.<br>   <b>A:</b> Charge it to whatever account you like.<br>   <b>B:</b> Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> Could you bring me some food, please?<br>   <b>B:</b> Sure. What do you fancy?<br>   <b>A:</b> Can I have a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium    rare?<br>   <b>B:</b> Sir, the filet mignon was so popular tonight that we ran out. May I suggest    the porterhouse?<br>   <b>A:</b> No filet? Okay, porterhouse will be fine then.<br>   <b>B:</b> Perhaps you would like chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?<br>   <b>A:</b> Not tonight, but thank you for the suggestion.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay. This will be charged to your amenities account, okay?<br>   <b>A:</b> No problem.<br>   <b>B:</b> Your food will be brought to you momentarily. I hope you enjoy it.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I'd like you to bring me some food.<br>   <b>B:</b> Just name it, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> Please send up a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium    rare.<br>   <b>B:</b> Regrettably, we're currently out of filet mignon. May I suggest the    porterhouse instead?<br>   <b>A:</b> Sure, I love porterhouse, too.<br>   <b>B:</b> Would you be interested in chocolate-covered strawberries with the    champagne?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'd love to, but I'm allergic to strawberries.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay, no strawberries tonight. The items will be charged to your amenities    account.<br>   <b>A:</b> Go right ahead.<br>   <b>B:</b> Our staff will bring you your order in as short a time as possible.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I need something to eat, please.<br>   <b>B:</b> Tell me what you're hungry for.<br>   <b>A:</b> I feel like champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.<br>   <b>B:</b> Unfortunately, we're out of filet mignon at the moment. May I suggest the    porterhouse instead?<br>   <b>A:</b> I prefer filet, but porterhouse is good, too.<br>   <b>B:</b> Perhaps I could interest you in chocolate-covered strawberries with the    champagne?<br>   <b>A:</b> Just the champagne will be fine, thank you.<br>   <b>B:</b> You'll see this charge on your amenities account.<br>   <b>A:</b> That's fine.<br>   <b>B:</b> It won't be long until your food is delivered. I know you'll enjoy it.<br>  <hr>            <b>A:</b> Can I order something from the kitchen?<br>   <b>B:</b> Just tell me what you'd like, please.<br>   <b>A:</b> A bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare would hit    the spot.<br>   <b>B:</b> I hate to tell you this, but we have no more filet mignon. May I suggest    the porterhouse instead?<br>   <b>A:</b> Sure! Right now, I would even eat hamburger!<br>   <b>B:</b> Have you ever tried chocolate-covered strawberries with champagne? <br>   <b>A:</b> Thank you, but I just finished eating some chocolate-covered cherries. <br>   <b>B:</b> That'll be a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and porterhouse, all    charged to your amenities account.<br>   <b>A:</b> Not a problem.<br>   <b>B:</b> Please call if you have any other requests. Your food will be delivered    promptly.<br>
