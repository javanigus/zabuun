				<h1>Selling a House</h1>
				<h2>Accepting an Offer</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> So how much did the buyers bid on our house?<br> <b>B:</b> Your asking price was three hundred thousand dollars. The potential buyers  offered two hundred ninety thousand dollars.<br> <b>A:</b> That's a great offer!<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, it is a good offer. Before you accept, we should look at some details.<br> <b>A:</b> What else do we need to look at?<br> <b>B:</b> They want you to pay all closing costs. Of course, they are making the sale  contingent on an inspection showing no major defects in the house.<br> <b>A:</b> I think that that sounds fair.<br> <b>B:</b> You could put in a counteroffer, but I know that these buyers also have their  eye on another house down the street.<br> <b>A:</b> I definitely want to accept their offer.<br> <b>B:</b> Excellent decision! I will notify them immediately.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I am so anxious to hear what the bid was on our house!<br> <b>B:</b> Remember that we set the asking price at three hundred thousand dollars. The  first offer is two hundred ninety thousand dollars.<br> <b>A:</b> That's way better than I expected so early in the game!<br> <b>B:</b> The offer is definitely a good one, but let's make sure we look at the whole  picture.<br> <b>A:</b> What are the other considerations?<br> <b>B:</b> They want you to pay for the inspection, but they want to pick out the  inspector. If the house is defective, they will want out of the deal.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't have a problem with that.<br> <b>B:</b> You could make them a counteroffer, but I know that you need a timely sale.<br> <b>A:</b> Please notify the buyers that I have accepted their offer.<br> <b>B:</b> I think that you are making the right choice. I will phone the buyers right  away!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> What did the buyers offer us on our house?<br> <b>B:</b> With the original asking price at three hundred thousand dollars, the buyers  are willing to pay two hundred ninety thousand dollars.<br> <b>A:</b> I am really pleased with that offer.<br> <b>B:</b> I agree that the offer is in the ballpark. We need to consider everything  before you accept.<br> <b>A:</b> Besides the selling price, what else is there to consider?<br> <b>B:</b> They want you to pay to have the cracks in the back wall fixed and a couple  of the roof tiles replaced.<br> <b>A:</b> All of that is acceptable to me.<br> <b>B:</b> A counteroffer by you is always a possibility, but their price is very close  to your asking price. You could risk losing the sale.<br> <b>A:</b> I wish to officially accept their offer.<br> <b>B:</b> This is a win-win situation for both you and the buyer. I am sure that you  will both be happy with your decision.<br>
