				<h2>Find a Church</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I can't believe we're actually moved in.<br> <b>B:</b> I know. It's like a dream come true.<br> <b>A:</b> We found the stores, and schools. It's time to find a church now.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. I can't believe I forgot about that.<br> <b>A:</b> We've been very busy, Marcy. That's okay.<br> <b>B:</b> How do we find one?<br> <b>A:</b> I guess we can call our old pastor.<br> <b>B:</b> That's right. He will know.<br> <b>A:</b> It's either that, or check the Internet.<br> <b>B:</b> I think I like the pastor idea better.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes. He can probably give us the name of the local pastor.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm so eager to start now.  </p>
