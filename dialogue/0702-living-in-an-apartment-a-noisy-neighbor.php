				<p>  <b>A:</b> I'm sorry to knock on your door at this late hour.<br> <b>B:</b> Is there something wrong?<br> <b>A:</b> It's just one minor issue I have to bring up with you.<br> <b>B:</b> Don't tell me. I think I know what it is.<br> <b>A:</b> I hope you can understand.<br> <b>B:</b> I completely do. I'm so sorry. I didn't realize how loud my television was.<br> <b>A:</b> It's just a little too loud. If you could just lower it a tad bit.<br> <b>B:</b> This is so embarrassing for me. You have my sincerest apology.<br> <b>A:</b> No, that's alright. It happens to all of us at one point.<br> <b>B:</b> It's these new speakers that I bought. I'm just learning how to use them.<br> <b>A:</b> Please, say no more. Let's just put the matter to rest.<br> <b>B:</b> This won't happen again.  </p>
