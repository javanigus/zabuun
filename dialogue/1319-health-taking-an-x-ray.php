We will be all done  	here.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I came here to get a chest X-ray.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will need you to take your clothes off from the waist up and put on the  	gown, leaving the opening in the back.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What comes next?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will need you to face this glass plate right over here.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Should I do anything else?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Your arms need to be raised to shoulder height.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Is this OK?<br> 	<b>B:</b> So far, so good.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How come you are walking away?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am not leaving. I just need you to take a really deep breath, hold it,  	and then let it out.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Will I be finished then?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You will be able to put your clothes on as soon as I have checked the  	film.<br>
