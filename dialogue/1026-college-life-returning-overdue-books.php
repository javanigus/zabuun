				<h2>Returning Overdue Books</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Can you help me with returning my late books?<br> <b>B:</b> This is the right spot to pay your fee. Put your books down right here.<br> <b>A:</b> OK, here they are.<br> <b>B:</b> I can see that you owe 25 cents a day. That will be one dollar and fifty  cents total.<br> <b>A:</b> OK, here's the money.<br> <b>B:</b> We are interested in getting our books back; so as long as all the fines are  paid off by the end of the semester, you will be fine. Does that make sense?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm not sure.<br> <b>B:</b> Your registration and transcripts can be held up if there is an outstanding  fine.<br> <b>A:</b> Now I understand.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, you can always keep your late fees down by using the night drop if we  are closed. Enjoy the library!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> These books should have been turned in last week.<br> <b>B:</b> You have come to the correct place. Hand me your books.<br> <b>A:</b> Here they are.<br> <b>B:</b> Whoa, these are pretty late! You owe five dollars total to clear your fine.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't have the money right now.<br> <b>B:</b> We only require that all fines must be paid off by the end of the semester.  So you will be okay to go.<br> <b>A:</b> What would happen if I didn't pay it?<br> <b>B:</b> It's really important to always clear your fines, so you'll get a report card  and transcripts on time.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, but I don't know how they can do that.<br> <b>B:</b> Always remember that the night drop is here, and we really appreciate you  returning your books for all to use.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> My library books are late, where can I put them?<br> <b>B:</b> This is where they need to be turned in. Let me see them to check the date,  OK?<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, I think that they are really late!<br> <b>B:</b> Not all that late. You only owe the library fifty cents.<br> <b>A:</b> What if I can't pay it?<br> <b>B:</b> We appreciate you paying off all fines as soon as possible, but always before  the end of the semester.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, I get it.<br> <b>B:</b> Your report card and transcripts will be held until you pay all fines, so  always make sure that you do that.<br> <b>A:</b> That's not really fair!<br> <b>B:</b> If we aren't here, always feel free to use the night drop outside. Thanks for  coming in!<br>
