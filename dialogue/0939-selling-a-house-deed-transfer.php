				<p>  <b>A:</b> My dad told me he was going to put his second house in my name.<br> <b>B:</b> The one on Bronson Street?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, that's the one.<br> <b>B:</b> Wow, that's a nice house.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, it is. He wants me to start taking on more responsibilities.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, that will do it. It's not easy managing a home.<br> <b>A:</b> I guess not, but I won't be living in it now.<br> <b>B:</b> So what's he doing?<br> <b>A:</b> He's just doing a Quit Claim deed.<br> <b>B:</b> What's that?<br> <b>A:</b> It's just a deed transfer changing ownership of the home.<br> <b>B:</b> It's not a sale?<br> <b>A:</b> No. It's usually done between family members.  </p>
