				<h1>At a Hotel</h1>
				<h2>Asking the Concierge for Sightseeing Advice</h2>
				    <b>A:</b> The front desk told me to ask you for sightseeing advice.<br>   <b>B:</b> Of course. I'd be more than happy to help. I am, after all, the hotel's    concierge.<br>   <b>A:</b> Concierge? What exactly is that?<br>   <b>B:</b> We advise you on where to visit, eat, or shop during your stay here in New    York.<br>   <b>A:</b> Great! So where should I start my sightseeing?<br>   <b>B:</b> The Statue of Liberty is always a good place to begin.<br>   <b>A:</b> I saw the Statue of Liberty on my last visit here. Can you recommend    somewhere else?<br>   <b>B:</b> Hmm. What type of interests do you have?<br>   <b>A:</b> In my spare time, I really like to view art and go running.<br>   <b>B:</b> Aha! Have you been to Central Park or the Museum of Modern Art?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, but I've heard a lot about both.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, Central Park is wonderful for running. Afterwards, you should head to    the Museum to enjoy the art.<br>   <b>A:</b> Great! That sounds like a plan. Thanks a lot.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm sure you'll have a good time there.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I was told to see you about going sightseeing.<br>   <b>B:</b> It's my pleasure. I'm the hotel's concierge, at your service.<br>   <b>A:</b> Concierge? Could you explain that to me?<br>   <b>B:</b> We help direct hotel visitors to popular places to visit, eat, and shop.<br>   <b>A:</b> Very good. So where shall I begin my sightseeing?<br>   <b>B:</b> I would suggest the Statue of Liberty.<br>   <b>A:</b> Gee, I've already seen the Statue of Liberty. What about another site?<br>   <b>B:</b> Let me see. What do you like to do in your spare time?<br>   <b>A:</b> I really like to run. And I like art.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, there you go! Have you ever visited either Central Park or the Museum    of Modern Art?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, but I've been meaning to.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, Central Park is fantastic for running. Then you can go to the Museum    to look at the beautiful art.<br>   <b>A:</b> That sounds like a great plan. I'll do that.<br>   <b>B:</b> Enjoy your run and your visit!<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I need some sightseeing advice.<br>   <b>B:</b> That's what I'm here for, sir. Every good hotel has a concierge like me.<br>   <b>A:</b> I don't travel a lot. What exactly is a concierge?<br>   <b>B:</b> A concierge helps visitors like you find great places to visit, shop, and    eat.<br>   <b>A:</b> That's great! So tell me, where should I go first?<br>   <b>B:</b> I'd suggest that you start at the Statue of Liberty.<br>   <b>A:</b> You know, I've already been there. Can you suggest another place?<br>   <b>B:</b> Maybe. Tell me what you like to do in your spare time.<br>   <b>A:</b> When I have some free time, I often spend it running or at museums.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, have you ever been to either Central Park or the Museum of Modern    Art?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, but I sure would like to.<br>   <b>B:</b> Central Park is great for just about everything outdoors. Then you can    visit the Museum of Modern Art.<br>   <b>A:</b> Both places sound great. I'll try to do that today.<br>   <b>B:</b> Enjoy the views at both places.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I'm going sightseeing, but I'd like to get your advice first.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm only too happy to help. Tourists should always check with their    concierge first.<br>   <b>A:</b> Concierge? I'm not familiar with that word.<br>   <b>B:</b> A concierge directs visitors to the city's great tourist, shopping, and    eating places.<br>   <b>A:</b> That sounds great. Now, is there any place that I should hit first?<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, if you're like most people, you'll want to go to the Statue of    Liberty.<br>   <b>A:</b> I've already seen it, I loved it, but today I want to go somewhere else.<br>   <b>B:</b> Sure! Tell me about your interests.<br>   <b>A:</b> I like to run and I like to see the works of the masters.<br>   <b>B:</b> You'll get along fabulously at Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art!    Have you been to either?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, I just haven't had the opportunity.<br>   <b>B:</b> You'll love Central Park for running. Later on, you can go to the Museum of    Modern Art.<br>   <b>A:</b> Thank you. That's what I'll do.<br>   <b>B:</b> This might be the best day of your visit.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I need some sightseeing advice. I was told to come to see you.<br>   <b>B:</b> As your concierge, it is my pleasure to help you, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> Concierge? Are we speaking English here?<br>   <b>B:</b> A concierge helps you find all the great places for visiting, shopping, and    eating.<br>   <b>A:</b> What would you suggest that I visit first?<br>   <b>B:</b> How about starting at the Statue of Liberty? Many people like to begin    there.<br>   <b>A:</b> The last time I was here, I visited the Statue. So do you have another    place in mind?<br>   <b>B:</b> I think so. Tell me what interests you.<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm big on running, although maybe I like art even more than running.<br>   <b>B:</b> Then you must go to Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art! Have you    been to either one?<br>   <b>A:</b> No. I haven't had a chance to go to either of them.<br>   <b>B:</b> Both places are usually crowded with natives and tourists. You'll love the    Park and the Museum.<br>   <b>A:</b> Thank you. That's great advice.<br>   <b>B:</b> This might be the best day of your visit.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> Can you give me some advice about going sightseeing? <br>   <b>B:</b> Your concierge, sir, is the right person to ask when you need sightseeing    advice.<br>   <b>A:</b> What in the world is a concierge?<br>   <b>B:</b> We direct visitors to all the great tourist, shopping, and eating spots in    the city.<br>   <b>A:</b> Then what would you recommend as a starting point for my sightseeing?<br>   <b>B:</b> Definitely the Statue of Liberty. I think that that is everyone's favorite    first stop. <br>   <b>A:</b> Actually, I've already been there twice. Do you have another suggestion?<br>   <b>B:</b> I think I can come up with something. How do you spend your spare time?<br>   <b>A:</b> I keep my body healthy by running and my mind active by visiting museums.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, the Museum of Modern Art and Central Park were made for you! Have you    gone to either one?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, although I've heard great things about both of them.<br>   <b>B:</b> You don't want to miss either place. Central Park and the Museum of Modern    Art are big and beautiful.<br>   <b>A:</b> Sounds great! I'll get my running gear and then I'm out of here.<br>   <b>B:</b> This is a day you're going to remember for a long time.<br>
