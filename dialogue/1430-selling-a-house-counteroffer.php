				<h1>Selling a House</h1>
				<h2>Counteroffer</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> I hear the young couple that came by the other day made an offer on our  house.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, the potential buyers made an offer this morning.<br> <b>A:</b> Is the offer a good offer?<br> <b>B:</b> The offer is pretty good. You asked three hundred thousand and they offered  two hundred eighty thousand.<br> <b>A:</b> I would be willing to take two hundred ninety thousand, but no lower.<br> <b>B:</b> You could make a counteroffer of two hundred ninety thousand dollars. Would  you like to do that?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I would like to make the counteroffer.<br> <b>B:</b> I will make the counteroffer immediately by phone.<br> <b>A:</b> What if they don't accept the counteroffer?<br> <b>B:</b> They can make a counteroffer themselves or state that their first offer  stands.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I got a message on my machine that you received an offer on my house.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, the offer came in late last night. It was too late to call you.<br> <b>A:</b> Is the offer as high as we were hoping for?<br> <b>B:</b> They offered two hundred eighty thousand dollars, and you were asking three  hundred thousand dollars. They are definitely in the ballpark.<br> <b>A:</b> I was prepared to go a little lower, but more like two hundred ninety  thousand dollars.<br> <b>B:</b> Would you like to make a counteroffer of two hundred ninety thousand dollars?<br> <b>A:</b> I definitely would like to make a counteroffer.<br> <b>B:</b> I will FAX them the counteroffer right away.<br> <b>A:</b> What if my counteroffer gets turned down?<br> <b>B:</b> They have an option of making a counteroffer, or they can just reject your  counteroffer.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Your office called and said that an offer came in on our house.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, the offer came in less than an hour ago.<br> <b>A:</b> How good of an offer did we receive?<br> <b>B:</b> Their bid was two hundred eighty thousand dollars, and you said that you  wanted three hundred thousand dollars. Their bid is a reasonable start.<br> <b>A:</b> We built a little leeway into the asking price, but I don't want to accept  less than two hundred ninety thousand dollars.<br> <b>B:</b> Sellers frequently make a counteroffer. Would you like to counteroffer two  hundred ninety thousand dollars?<br> <b>A:</b> I think that a counteroffer would be wise at this point.<br> <b>B:</b> I will contact their agent right away with your counteroffer.<br> <b>A:</b> What should we do if they don't like the counteroffer?<br> <b>B:</b> If the seller doesn't want to accept your counteroffer, they can reject it or  come up with a counteroffer of their own.<br>
