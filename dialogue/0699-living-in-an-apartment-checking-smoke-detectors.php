				<h2>Checking Smoke Detectors</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Have you checked your smoke detectors recently?<br> <b>B:</b> No, I wasn't even aware we had smoke detectors.<br> <b>A:</b> All the apartments are equipped with them. It's an essential safety feature.<br> <b>B:</b> How do you check if they're working?<br> <b>A:</b> It's real easy. If you like, I could show you.<br> <b>B:</b> That would be nice of you.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you doing anything right now?<br> <b>B:</b> No. It's my day off work.<br> <b>A:</b> How about I come over and show you how to check them?<br> <b>B:</b> Sounds good. Come inside.<br> <b>A:</b> It's really easy to check them. Just grab one from the wall, and check the battery in the back.<br> <b>B:</b> What does this light mean?<br> <b>A:</b> If you see the light, that means it's functioning.<br> <b>B:</b> So I don't need to replace the battery. Thank you so much.  </p>
