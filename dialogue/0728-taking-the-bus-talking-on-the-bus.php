				<h2>Talking on the Bus (1)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I'm going to be so late. This bus driver is driving so slowly.<br> <b>B:</b> Where are you in a hurry to?<br> <b>A:</b> I have doctor's appointment. I hope I make it on time.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sure you will. Where's your clinic?<br> <b>A:</b> It's in Long Beach.<br> <b>B:</b> I'd say we're about twenty minutes away from there.<br> <b>A:</b> I sure hope you're right about that. Where are you heading to?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm going to visit my grandma.<br> <b>A:</b> Where does she live?<br> <b>B:</b> She's also in Long Beach.<br> <b>A:</b> What a coincidence! Do you often ride this bus to visit her?<br> <b>B:</b> I have for the past two years. I visit her every Sunday.<br> <b>A:</b> That's so sweet of you. You must love her very much.<br> <b>B:</b> I do. Why are you going to the doctor's?<br> <b>A:</b> To get my routine check-up. Nothing serious.<br> <b>B:</b> It's so nice to meet friendly people on the bus.  </p>
