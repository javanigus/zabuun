				<h2>Borrowing Class Notes</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Can I borrow your class notes from yesterday's lecture?<br> <b>B:</b> Heck no! You're so lazy.<br> <b>A:</b> What are you talking about? I was sick yesterday.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't care. Ask someone else.<br> <b>A:</b> You're so mean!<br> <b>B:</b> I can't let anyone borrow my class notes.<br> <b>A:</b> Why not? They're just notes.<br> <b>B:</b> I let a classmate borrow my notes once, and she sold copies to people.<br> <b>A:</b> That's crazy! For how much?<br> <b>B:</b> She sold each class note set for $5.<br> <b>A:</b> Don't worry, I promise not to sell your notes.<br> <b>B:</b> I can't take your word for it.  </p>
