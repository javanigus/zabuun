				<h2>A Tough Choice</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Beer is a powerful drug.<br> <b>B:</b> So are cigarettes.<br> <b>A:</b> Which would you prefer?<br> <b>B:</b> What do you mean?<br> <b>A:</b> When you die and go to heaven, they will offer you beer or cigarettes.<br> <b>B:</b> I could pick only one or the other?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes. Nothing's perfect, not even in heaven.<br> <b>B:</b> Boy, that's a tough one.<br> <b>A:</b> What's so tough about it? Of course, I would pick cigarettes.<br> <b>B:</b> But cigarettes taste much better when you have a cold beer.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, you can't have everything.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't think I want to go to your heaven.  </p>
