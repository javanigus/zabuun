				<h2>Picking Up at the Airport</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> Would you be able to pick me up at the airport next Sunday?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Sure, I would be happy to help you. What time are you arriving?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I will be arriving at 3:00 in the afternoon.<br> 	<b>B:</b> By the time you pick up your luggage, it will be around 3:30. What if I  	meet you outside at the curb?<br> 	<b>A:</b> That would be a good time to meet, but what if I am running late?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I can track your plane online. I can just put in the flight number and I  	can see if you are on time.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can you make sure that you have your cell phone with you so I can call  	you?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, that would be good idea.<br> 	<b>A:</b> If something happens and you can't make it, just let me know and I'll  	book a Super Shuttle.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Don't worry. I'll be able to pick you up.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I am flying in next Sunday and was wondering if you might be able to pick  	me up at the airport.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I can pick you up. What time does your flight arrive?<br> 	<b>A:</b> My flight arrives at 3:00 in the afternoon.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think if I am at the curb at 3:30, that would allow you time to pick up  	your luggage. How does that sound?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that would work out well, but what if the plane is late?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I can call the airline, and they will tell me if the flight is delayed.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am going to carry my cell phone so I can call you.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, that would help us find each other at the airport.<br> 	<b>A:</b> If you find that you have to make other plans, I can always book a Super  	Shuttle to pick me up.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You don't have to take a Super Shuttle. I'll be there.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> Could you help me out and pick me up at the airport next Sunday?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It would be no problem to pick you up. When is your flight arriving?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am coming in around 3:00 in the afternoon.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think that by the time we factor in half an hour to clear Customs, that  	maybe I should meet you at the curb at 3:30.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I will meet you at the curb, but how will you know if the plane is  	delayed?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Don't worry. I can track your flight on my iPhone browser.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I want to be able to call you on my cell phone in a pinch.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I'll make sure to keep my cell phone with me and turned on.<br> 	<b>A:</b> If it doesn't work out, just let me know and I can take a Super Shuttle.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You won't need to take a Super Shuttle. Just stay in touch and look for  	me!<br>
