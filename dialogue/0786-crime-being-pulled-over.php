I guess I was in a rush.<br> <b>A:</b> Where are you rushing to?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm late picking up my kids from school.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm going to have to give you a ticket.<br> <b>B:</b> Can't you just let me off with a warning? I'll be more careful next time.<br> <b>A:</b> You could have caused an accident and never made it to get your kids.<br> <b>B:</b> You have a point, officer.  </p>
