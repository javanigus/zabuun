				<p>  <b>A:</b> I desperately need to take an English class this semester.<br> <b>B:</b> So does everyone else.<br> <b>A:</b> It's the only class I need before I transfer.<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe you can pay someone for their spot. <br> <b>A:</b> I honestly would do that if someone was willing to give up their spot.<br> <b>B:</b> What happens if you can't get the class?<br> <b>A:</b> Then I need to stay at Pasadena City College longer.<br> <b>B:</b> That would stink.<br> <b>A:</b> I know, that's why I need that class.<br> <b>B:</b> You can try taking it at another college.<br> <b>A:</b> I might do that. The closest community college is a two-hour drive.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm praying you get the English class.  </p>
