				<p>  <b>A:</b> I need a cab to the theater district.<br> <b>B:</b> We can get that for you right away.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, I don't need to be there for another hour.<br> <b>B:</b> Would you like to reserve a limo then?<br> <b>A:</b> That seems a bit much for me. Just a regular cab is fine.<br> <b>B:</b> We can't reserve a taxi that far in advance, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> So how do I get a cab in an hour then?<br> <b>B:</b> If you go right outside our lobby when you are ready, a staff member will hail  one for you.<br> <b>A:</b> Do I have to tip the guy who gets the cab for me?<br> <b>B:</b> Tips aren't mandatory, but they are appreciated.<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe I'll just hail the cab myself then.<br> <b>B:</b> That's also an option.  </p>
