				<h1>At a Hotel</h1>
				<h2>Getting a Taxi via the Front Desk</h2>
				    <b>A:</b> I need to get a taxi.<br>   <b>B:</b> We have a variety of transportation services. Would you prefer a private    vehicle to a taxi?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, that won't be necessary. I just need a taxi.<br>   <b>B:</b> Perhaps you'd prefer a limousine. That's such a stylish way to travel.<br>   <b>A:</b> Just a taxi, please.<br>   <b>B:</b> And what is your destination?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm going to Rockefeller Center.<br>   <b>B:</b> I see. What time do you want to depart from the hotel?<br>   <b>A:</b> I want to leave as soon as possible.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay, a taxi will arrive in seconds, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> Thank you, I'm coming down now.<br>   <b>B:</b> It won't be but a few seconds, sir.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I need a taxi, please.<br>   <b>B:</b> We have various transportation services. Would you prefer a private    vehicle?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, thanks. A taxi is just fine.<br>   <b>B:</b> May I suggest a limo? It's nice to pamper yourself once in a while.<br>   <b>A:</b> I don't want anything except a taxi, thank you.<br>   <b>B:</b> I understand. And where will you be going?<br>   <b>A:</b> Rockefeller Center.<br>   <b>B:</b> And what time would you like to be picked up?<br>   <b>A:</b> The sooner the better.<br>   <b>B:</b> A taxi will be here shortly, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> Great! And remember, a taxi, not a limo.<br>   <b>B:</b> A taxi it is, sir.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> Can you get me a taxi?<br>   <b>B:</b> We offer various types of transportation. Perhaps you'd like to upgrade to    a private vehicle?<br>   <b>A:</b> Thanks, but no thanks. A taxi will do just fine.<br>   <b>B:</b> In that case, how about a limo? Then you can travel in style.<br>   <b>A:</b> No, I hate limousines. They're gas guzzlers.<br>   <b>B:</b> Got it, sir. Where would you like the taxi to take you?<br>   <b>A:</b> My destination is Rockefeller Center.<br>   <b>B:</b> What time do you want to leave the hotel?<br>   <b>A:</b> As soon as possible.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'll call the taxi immediately, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm coming downstairs now.<br>   <b>B:</b> A brand new taxi is pulling up now, sir.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I'm going to need a taxi.<br>   <b>B:</b> You don't have to restrict yourself to a taxi. We can offer you a private    vehicle.<br>   <b>A:</b> A private vehicle, huh? No, a taxi is okay.<br>   <b>B:</b> Some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi.<br>   <b>A:</b> No, I wouldn't be caught dead in a limo.<br>   <b>B:</b> No upgrade of any kind. And where might you be going?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm headed to Rockefeller Center.<br>   <b>B:</b> When shall I tell the taxi to be here?<br>   <b>A:</b> Right now.<br>   <b>B:</b> The taxi will be here immediately, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> Good, I'm leaving my room in about one minute.<br>   <b>B:</b> You won't have to wait a second, sir.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I need a taxi.<br>   <b>B:</b> We could easily provide you with a private vehicle, if you'd prefer.<br>   <b>A:</b> No, the taxi will do.<br>   <b>B:</b> Perhaps you'd like to take a beautiful limousine.<br>   <b>A:</b> No, thank you. Taxis and I get along just fine.<br>   <b>B:</b> No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center.<br>   <b>B:</b> What time should the taxi be here to pick you up?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm ready to go right now.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs.<br>   <b>B:</b> You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> Could you please reserve a taxi for me?<br>   <b>B:</b> Do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking?<br>   <b>A:</b> A private vehicle? No, thanks, I won't need one.<br>   <b>B:</b> Even better than a private vehicle is a limo. How does that sound?<br>   <b>A:</b> T A X I, please.<br>   <b>B:</b> A taxi it is. Where will you be headed? <br>   <b>A:</b> Rockefeller Center. Can you get the taxi here immediately, please?<br>   <b>B:</b> A taxi will be here in just a minute, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> Good. I'll get my coat and come downstairs.<br>   <b>B:</b> The taxi will be ready when you are, sir.<br>
