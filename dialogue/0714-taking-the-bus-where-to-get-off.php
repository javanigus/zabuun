				<p>  <b>A:</b> Is this your first time riding the bus?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, it is. How did you tell?<br> <b>A:</b> The look on your face gave it away.<br> <b>B:</b> I really do look that confused?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm sorry to say so, but don't be embarrassed.<br> <b>B:</b> You seem friendly. Would you mind answering a question?<br> <b>A:</b> No, not at all. What's your question?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm trying to get to the airport. Do you know where I should get off?<br> <b>A:</b> This bus actually drops you off right in front of the airport.<br> <b>B:</b> I know that it does. I've just forgotten on what street.<br> <b>A:</b> The stop will say LAX Airport.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, really. That's pretty obvious.  </p>
