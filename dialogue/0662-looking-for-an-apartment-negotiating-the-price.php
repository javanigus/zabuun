				<p>  <b>A:</b> Is there anything I can say or do to make you lower the monthly rent?<br> <b>B:</b> I doubt it, but let me hear you out.<br> <b>A:</b> If you lower the price, I will mow the lawn and trim the hedges every month.<br> <b>B:</b> No, I already have someone who does that.<br> <b>A:</b> What if I give you the first two months' rent in advance?<br> <b>B:</b> No deal. Sorry, kid.<br> <b>A:</b> Looks like I can't convince you to lower the rent.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, but that was a good effort.<br> <b>A:</b> I guess I'm going to have such a hard time paying rent.<br> <b>B:</b> Don't look so down now.<br> <b>A:</b> I can't help it.<br> <b>B:</b> Alright, you win! I'll lower the price.  </p>
