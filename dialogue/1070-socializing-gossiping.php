				  <b>A:</b> Hi Julie, how are things going?<br> <b>B:</b> Everything is great, Tad. How are you?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm doing really well.<br> <b>B:</b> Tad, I'm pretty hungry right now. Want to walk over and check out the food  table?<br> <b>A:</b> Julie, do you know who that woman is over there by the window?<br> <b>B:</b> That is Mary. I heard that she's just moved in with Lee.<br> <b>A:</b> I thought that he was with Malia.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, that relationship is history. Malia hooked up with a guy she met on  holiday.<br> <b>A:</b> I bet that Lee wasn't too happy with that!<br> <b>B:</b> Actually, he was OK with it. They hadn't been getting along too well.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Hi Julie, how are you?<br> <b>B:</b> Things are going good, Tad. How about you?<br> <b>A:</b> Things have been going well for me.<br> <b>B:</b> That food smells delicious! Let's wander over to the food table and see  what's up.<br> <b>A:</b> Julie, do you know who that woman talking to Lee is?<br> <b>B:</b> I think that her name is Mary. I think that she and Lee are moving in  together.<br> <b>A:</b> Isn't he with Malia?<br> <b>B:</b> Malia dumped him. She ran off with a guy she met on vacation.<br> <b>A:</b> Lee was probably less than thrilled with that!<br> <b>B:</b> He was kind of relieved. They had been having some problems.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Hi Julie, how have things been going for you?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm good, Tad. How are things with you?<br> <b>A:</b> Things couldn't be better right now.<br> <b>B:</b> Boy, that's quite a spread over on the food table! Let's go check out the  party food.<br> <b>A:</b> Julie, who is the woman sitting next to Lee on the sofa?<br> <b>B:</b> Someone told me her name is Mary. Supposedly, she and Lee are living together  in Lee's apartment.<br> <b>A:</b> What about his relationship with Malia?<br> <b>B:</b> Malia is no longer in the picture. She moved to Australia to be with a guy  she met on vacation.<br> <b>A:</b> How did Lee feel about that happening?<br> <b>B:</b> He took it pretty well. I think that he had kind of had his eye on Mary for a  while.<br>
