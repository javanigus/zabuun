				<h2>Life after Death</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> What are you going to do about your death?<br> <b>B:</b> Well, mostly I'll try to avoid it.<br> <b>A:</b> I mean, are you going to get buried or cremated?<br> <b>B:</b> My wife and I will be cremated.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you going to be buried next to each other?<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, no. Our ashes will be shaken into the ocean.<br> <b>A:</b> You're not going to be buried?<br> <b>B:</b> A coffin costs too much and takes up too much space.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, but it will be in a cemetery where your children can visit you.<br> <b>B:</b> Children seldom visit their parents in a cemetery.<br> <b>A:</b> That's true. A cemetery is for dead people, not living people.<br> <b>B:</b> We figure our kids can visit us whenever they go to the beach.  </p>
