				<h1>Buying a Car</h1>
				<h2>Deciding to Buy the Car</h2>
				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I really like that car and I am thinking of buying it.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I agree. Do you want to take it to a mechanic to have it checked out?<br> <b>A:</b> I already took care of that yesterday.<br> <b>B:</b> That's good. Have you discussed the price with the seller?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I think we've agreed upon a fair price.<br> <b>B:</b> Have you set up your financing to pay for this car?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, my parents are going to loan me the money.<br> <b>B:</b> That's good. Would you like me to go talk to the seller with you and drive  your car home?<br> <b>A:</b> That would be a great help!<br> <b>B:</b> Glad to be of help. I can't wait to see your new car!<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> That car is exactly what I want, so I probably should buy it.<br> <b>B:</b> From what I see, it's a good deal. Should a mechanic check it out for you?<br> <b>A:</b> A mechanic looked at it for me on Tuesday when I first looked at it.<br> <b>B:</b> It's good that you took care of that. Have you agreed upon a price with the  seller?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, he was willing to lower his price a bit and I'm good with that.<br> <b>B:</b> Do you know how you are going to pay for this car?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I have already pre-qualified for a loan with my credit union.<br> <b>B:</b> You are very well prepared! I could go with you to talk to the seller and  help you get your car home.<br> <b>A:</b> I appreciate the offer of help!<br> <b>B:</b> It will be my pleasure to help you. I am looking forward to riding in your  new car.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I think that that car drove really well and is a good deal.<br> <b>B:</b> It seems to be a good choice for you. You might want to have a mechanic take  a look at it just to be sure.<br> <b>A:</b> My friend is a mechanic and he came and looked at it for me this morning.<br> <b>B:</b> That was smart of you to think ahead. Have you and the seller agreed upon a  price?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, he is willing to accept the price that I offered him.<br> <b>B:</b> Have you thought about how to pay for your car?<br> <b>A:</b> I saved up enough money to pay cash for this car.<br> <b>B:</b> You've really thought this through. Let me go with you to make the payment  and drive your car home for you.<br> <b>A:</b> That would make it a lot easier for me.<br> <b>B:</b> Let's go take care of that right now. I really want to see your new car!<br>
