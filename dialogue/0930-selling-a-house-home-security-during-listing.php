				<h2>Home Security During Listing</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I must admit, Ms. Price, I'm concerned about security.<br> <b>B:</b> Don't worry, Mr. King. We will provide the security on your home.<br> <b>A:</b> What kinds of things do you do?<br> <b>B:</b> We make it look like someone is living in your home while it's listed.<br> <b>A:</b> How do you do that?<br> <b>B:</b> We do several things. We stop deliveries, mow the lawn, and set timers.<br> <b>A:</b> Is that all you do?<br> <b>B:</b> No, we have our agents drop by from time to time.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, that's good.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, we take home security seriously.<br> <b>A:</b> Thanks, Ms. Price. I feel much better now.<br> <b>B:</b> You are very welcome. Thank you.  </p>
