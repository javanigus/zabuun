				<h2>Making Alternate Plans</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> I guess that we won't be going rollerblading today with all this rain!<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, rollerblading in six inches of water would not be fun. What would  	you like to do instead?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that maybe we could check out the local mall, grab some lunch,  	and maybe see a movie.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes, that sounds like a relaxing way to check out the local culture and  	still stay dry.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What else could we do in bad weather?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You know, we could take a double-decker bus tour of famous haunted houses  	and buildings.<br> 	<b>A:</b> That would be fun, and the rain would only add to the atmosphere.<br> 	<b>B:</b> There is an old English pub next door. Maybe when we finish with the  	haunted house, we can duck in there for some brew.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What a great idea!<br> 	<b>B:</b> If we are lucky, maybe they'll have some great food at the pub for  	supper.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> This rain sort of blows our chances of going rollerblading!<br> 	<b>B:</b> No, I don't think that we will be able to do what we planned to do. What  	can we do for fun today?<br> 	<b>A:</b> There is a large indoor mall just down the street with an incredible ice  	rink we could check out.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We could stay inside and dry, and still get out of this hotel room for a  	while.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am trying to think of something else that we could do in bad weather.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We could sign up for that double-decker bus tour of haunted houses.<br> 	<b>A:</b> The rainy day would only add to the haunted house atmosphere.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think that when we are done with our haunted house touring, we should  	pop into the English pub next door for a beer.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I could go for that!<br> 	<b>B:</b> I hope that we can get some nice hot food for dinner at the pub.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> I think that rollerblading today is kind of not happening in this  	rainstorm.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We definitely need to come up with a different plan to amuse ourselves.  	What do you think would be fun?<br> 	<b>A:</b> There is a large indoor mall hooked onto the Modern Art Museum just down  	the street.<br> 	<b>B:</b> That would allow us to stay dry and still get a feel for the local  	culture.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I wonder what the locals do in bad weather.<br> 	<b>B:</b> There is a sign for a double-decker tour of haunted houses in the lobby.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Haunted houses would be a perfect outing for a rainy day!<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think we should wrap up our rainy haunted house day with some ale at  	the English pub down the street.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that rainy days and pubs go together!<br> 	<b>B:</b> Usually pubs have some pretty good cold-weather food. Maybe we can have  	dinner there.<br>
