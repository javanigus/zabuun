				<h2>An Earthquake</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Did you feel the earthquake last night?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, the whole house was shaking!<br> <b>A:</b> I was afraid the windows would shatter!<br> <b>B:</b> A lot of my collectibles fell off their shelves.<br> <b>A:</b> Did they break?<br> <b>B:</b> Unfortunately. Some of them can be fixed, though.<br> <b>A:</b> My cat was outside when the earthquake started.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh no! That's terrible! Is she ok?<br> <b>A:</b> She's fine. Animals have good natural instincts.<br> <b>B:</b> I wish people could predict earthquakes, too.<br> <b>A:</b> I think it would just make people panic more easily.<br> <b>B:</b> You're right. Maybe it's best to leave it to cats.  </p>
