				<h1>Selling a House</h1>
				<h2>Deciding Which Offer to Accept</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Your office called and left a message that several offers had come in on our  home.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, we received three offers in one day for your home!<br> <b>A:</b> Were the offers for a good price?<br> <b>B:</b> One offer was for the full asking price, one slightly below, and one above.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, I am going to accept the highest bid, of course!<br> <b>B:</b> Actually there are a few things to consider other than who is offering the  most money.<br> <b>A:</b> What other factors do I need to consider?<br> <b>B:</b> We need to consider the likelihood of the buyers actually being able to  purchase the house.<br> <b>A:</b> How do we check on the buyer's ability to purchase our home?<br> <b>B:</b> We will check to see if these buyers are pre-qualified for the loan amount  that they need. This information will help you make a good decision.<br> <b>A:</b> When we get all of that information, then I will make my decision.<br> <b>B:</b> When you make that decision, I will present it to the buyers.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I received your e-mail about the many purchase offers for my house.<br> <b>B:</b> It has been quite a busy day regarding your home. We just received three  offers!<br> <b>A:</b> Did the potential buyers offer a good price?<br> <b>B:</b> There were offers above and below your asking price, as well as one exactly  for the asking price.<br> <b>A:</b> The highest bid is always the best bid!<br> <b>B:</b> We need to look at the big picture in deciding which bid to accept.<br> <b>A:</b> What things would you like me to look at?<br> <b>B:</b> Just because a buyer offers the money doesn't mean that they actually have  the credit to purchase the home.<br> <b>A:</b> How do I get the information about a buyer's ability to afford to buy a home?<br> <b>B:</b> We will check to see if any of these buyers have a large down payment. A  large amount of available cash would be a good sign.<br> <b>A:</b> I will wait for that information and give you my answer.<br> <b>B:</b> Please let me know when you have made your decision, and I will contact the  buyers.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> My friend said that you had called regarding multiple offers for my home.<br> <b>B:</b> The Open House was quite a success. Last night we received three offers on  your home!<br> <b>A:</b> I am anxious to hear how good an offer we received!<br> <b>B:</b> Offers above and below the asking price came in. One was right on the money.<br> <b>A:</b> Let's go with the highest bid!<br> <b>B:</b> We need to look at a number of factors in deciding which bid to go with.<br> <b>A:</b> What matters besides getting the money for the house?<br> <b>B:</b> We need to make sure that these potential buyers all actually qualify to even  purchase a home.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't even know where to begin checking on a buyer's credit information.<br> <b>B:</b> We can check to see if these buyers have already sold their current home.  This would make them more desirable. <br> <b>A:</b> I think that gathering that information will be helpful to me.<br> <b>B:</b> Please let me know if I can further assist you in making your decision.<br>
