				<h2>Moving Day</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Is the moving van here yet?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, it just pulled up to the curb. Here we go! <br> <b>A:</b> Could you double-check and make sure that everything made it into the boxes?<br> <b>B:</b> I have already done that. Would you like me to put our suitcases into the  car?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, this would be a good time to do that.<br> <b>B:</b> I am so glad that we took the time to pack our essentials into suitcases. It  will tide us over until the van arrives at our new home.<br> <b>A:</b> Would this be a good time to pack the frozen food into the ice chest?<br> <b>B:</b> I think that we should wait until the very last minute to do that.<br> <b>A:</b> I am going to take the dog for a walk so that he doesn't get too stressed out  as the movers are working.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, let's get started sweeping up and do a last minute cleaning.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Do you think that the moving van has arrived?<br> <b>B:</b> It's coming down the street even as we speak.<br> <b>A:</b> Could I ask you to make one last check to make sure that everything got into  the boxes?<br> <b>B:</b> Relax. Do you need me to put the suitcases in the car?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, let's do that right now. <br> <b>B:</b> It was such a good idea to pack a suitcase to have some things with us while  we are waiting for the moving van to arrive on the other end.<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe we could pack the frozen food into the ice chest?<br> <b>B:</b> Let's wait until the van is almost completely loaded to take care of that.<br> <b>A:</b> I am sure happy that we dropped the cats off at the kennel so they aren't  freaking out.<br> <b>B:</b> I am going to start sweeping up the floor. I want the new owners to not have  to clean up a mess.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Could you check and see if the moving van is out there yet?<br> <b>B:</b> It just arrived. They are parking at the curb right now.<br> <b>A:</b> Do me a favor and do one last walk-through to check for anything that may not  have gotten packed.<br> <b>B:</b> We've already double-checked everything. Should we put the suitcases in the  car?<br> <b>A:</b> It is the perfect time to take care of that.<br> <b>B:</b> I am so happy that we didn't pack all of our clothes into boxes. The suitcase  of clothes will help us get to what we need until our boxes arrive.<br> <b>A:</b> Should we empty the freezer into the ice chest?<br> <b>B:</b> Let's do a few more things and then take care of that as one of the last  things we do.<br> <b>A:</b> Deciding to keep the birds at the neighbors until we leave was a good idea.<br> <b>B:</b> Let's sweep the floor on our way out so we don't leave too big of a mess  behind.<br>
