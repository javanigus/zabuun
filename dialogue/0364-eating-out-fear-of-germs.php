See if his hands and nails are clean.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, the waiter looked clean, so I guess it's okay to eat here.<br> <b>B:</b> You're forgetting about the bathroom.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm going to just hope that the bathroom is clean.<br> <b>B:</b> You're not going to examine it before we order dinner?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I'd rather not find out that it's dirty, because I'm pretty hungry right now.<br> <b>B:</b> Me, too.
