				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Do you realize what time it is?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, I lost track of time.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you honestly believe that that is a good excuse?<br> <b>B:</b> Not at all--that is what really happened.<br> <b>A:</b> How many times do I have to ask you to call if you're going to be late?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I know. I must've forgot.<br> <b>A:</b> That's beside the point, you still should have called.<br> <b>B:</b> You're right. I'm sorry.<br> <b>A:</b> Next time you come in late without calling, you're gone.<br> <b>B:</b> You're really going to kick me out?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, maybe then you'll figure out how to follow the rules.<br> <b>B:</b> Actually, if you kick me out, your rules won't matter anymore.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Do you have any idea what time it is?<br> <b>B:</b> My bad. I didn't realize that it was so late.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you really think that that excuses your tardiness?<br> <b>B:</b> Of course not. I really did lose track of time.<br> <b>A:</b> Didn't I tell you to call when you're running late?<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah, you did. I just forgot to call.<br> <b>A:</b> It doesn't matter, you should have called and let me know.<br> <b>B:</b> That's true. My bad for not calling.<br> <b>A:</b> If you do this again, don't even bother coming home.<br> <b>B:</b> You're going to kick me out over this?<br> <b>A:</b> Exactly, maybe that'll teach you to respect my rules.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, if I'm not living here anymore, then I won't have to listen to your  rules.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Do you know how late it is?<br> <b>B:</b> My fault. I didn't realize what time it was.<br> <b>A:</b> I hope you don't think that excuse lets you off the hook.<br> <b>B:</b> Not really. I'm telling the truth.<br> <b>A:</b> Haven't I asked you to call if you're going to be home late?<br> <b>B:</b> This is true, but it must've slipped my mind.<br> <b>A:</b> Regardless, all you had to do was give a call.<br> <b>B:</b> I know. I should've called.<br> <b>A:</b> Come home late one more time, and you'll find your stuff outside.<br> <b>B:</b> You want to throw me out over this?<br> <b>A:</b> That's right, maybe then you'll respect my rules.<br> <b>B:</b> That's fine, because if I leave, then your rules won't matter.<br>
