				<h1>Selling a House</h1>

				  <b>A:</b> Thank you for coming to look at my house.<br> <b>B:</b> I really wanted to take a look and help give you an idea of what we need to  do.<br> <b>A:</b> When will people come to look at my house?<br> <b>B:</b> Basically, there are two ways people can view your home. They can come to an  Open House or they can come with a Realtor to view it during a private  appointment.<br> <b>A:</b> Will people from other real estate offices be involved, or just from your  office?<br> <b>B:</b> Your house is going to be listed as a Multiple Listing so that it will have  the maximum exposure to a variety of people.<br> <b>A:</b> Will I know when people are going to come see my house?<br> <b>B:</b> We will set the parameters in the contract, but usually you will receive at  least four hours of notification that someone is coming.<br> <b>A:</b> What happens during an Open House day?<br> <b>B:</b> You will be expected to be away during an Open House. I will take care of the  details.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I appreciate you dropping by to look at my home.<br> <b>B:</b> It is useful for us to take a walk through your home together, so that we  make sure that we are on the same page.<br> <b>A:</b> How do you show my home to potential buyers?<br> <b>B:</b> We will have an Open House or two on a weekend and we also will show your  home with private appointments during the week.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you the only real estate office that will be showing my house?<br> <b>B:</b> We are placing your house as a Multiple Listing. That way, people who don't  work for my particular office can show your home to their clients.<br> <b>A:</b> How will I know when to expect prospective buyers?<br> <b>B:</b> That will be set in your contract. Usually, you will be given four hours  notice.<br> <b>A:</b> Can I stay home during an Open House day?<br> <b>B:</b> The seller is never at home during an Open House. I personally will handle  the showing of your home.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Thanks for stopping by to evaluate my home.<br> <b>B:</b> I want to make sure that you are very clear on what the steps are to selling  a home.<br> <b>A:</b> When can people come and see my home?<br> <b>B:</b> We will have several Open House weekends.

That way it  will be shown by a variety of realtors.<br> <b>A:</b> Can people just drop in anytime they feel like it?<br> <b>B:</b> We usually try and give you at least four hours of notification that someone  is coming to look at your home.<br> <b>A:</b> Will I have to go away during an Open House day?<br> <b>B:</b> I will handle all of the work involved for the Open House. The only thing  that you need to do is be somewhere else!<br>
