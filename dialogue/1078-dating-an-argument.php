				<h2>An Argument</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> John, I was talking to the travel agent about where we might  be taking our vacation this year.<br> <b>B:</b> I am going fishing in Alaska with my friend, Mark.<br> <b>A:</b> What are you talking about?<br> <b>B:</b> What's wrong with heading out with Mark for vacation?<br> <b>A:</b> You and I have been together for a whole year, and our vacation time should  be about the two of us!<br> <b>B:</b> Really? Who made that rule up?<br> <b>A:</b> With that attitude, I don't really think we have much more to discuss here.<br> <b>B:</b> That works for me!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> John, I was looking through some magazines for ideas about  where we might go on vacation this year.<br> <b>B:</b> I've already told my buddy, Mark, that I am going hunting with him in Alaska.<br> <b>A:</b> You can't be serious!<br> <b>B:</b> Hey, I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation. I am sorry that bothers  you.<br> <b>A:</b> After a year together, I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would  automatically spend our vacation together.<br> <b>B:</b> Says who? I don't think that is necessarily the case.<br> <b>A:</b> You know, now that I think about it, I really don't have much more to say to  you at all!<br> <b>B:</b> Whatever you say!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Brian and Christina were mentioning that maybe it would be  fun to go on vacation together this year, John.<br> <b>B:</b> I thought that I already told you that I am going with Mark to Alaska.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you kidding me?<br> <b>B:</b> You know what? You and I had no plans, so I made plans with Mark. What's the  problem?<br> <b>A:</b> We have been together for a year and usually, people who've been together a  year, take their vacation together.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't think that I ever heard of that rule before. Any more rules that you  would like to tell me about?<br> <b>A:</b> Go on your vacation with Mark and when you come back, why don't you just move  in with him as well!<br> <b>B:</b> I am really looking forward to getting away from you. Far away from you!<br>
