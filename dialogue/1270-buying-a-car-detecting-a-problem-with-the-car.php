				<h1>Buying a Car</h1>
				<h2>Detecting a Problem with the Car</h2>
				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I was thinking about buying this used car, and was wondering  if you would take a look at it for me to see if it has any problems.<br> <b>B:</b> Sure, pull up over there and we'll take a look.<br> <b>A:</b> I just wasn't sure what to look for.<br> <b>B:</b> The first thing you do is look for any signs of wear both inside and out. We  will also look at the body for signs of major repair.<br> <b>A:</b> Someone told me that I could go online and see if the car is listed as having  been in a major accident.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, that's right. Next, we will turn on the engine and I will check under  the hood to look at the hoses and belts.<br> <b>A:</b> Should we take the car for a drive?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, but before we pull away, let's check to make sure that the radio, turn  signals, lights, and seats all work properly.<br> <b>A:</b> As I am driving what should I be checking?<br> <b>B:</b> You want to make sure that the brakes don't pull to one side and that the car  has good alignment and acceleration.<br> <b>A:</b> Thanks for your help.<br> <b>B:</b> You are welcome. Enjoy driving your car!<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Could you take a few minutes and see if there are any  problems with this used car that I am thinking of buying?<br> <b>B:</b> I am happy to help. Just pull up and we'll give it a good look.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't know much about cars.<br> <b>B:</b> We need to look inside and outside for signs of an accident or major damage.  Also, we need to look for wear on the tires.<br> <b>A:</b> If I go online I can also check to see if the car has been involved in a  major accident.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, you can check the history of the car online. Next, we need to turn on  the engine and take a look at the belts and hoses.<br> <b>A:</b> Will you take a drive with me to check handling?<br> <b>B:</b> A test drive would be good. But first let's make sure that the turn signals,  radio, lights, and seats work properly.<br> <b>A:</b> On a test drive, what should I look for?<br> <b>B:</b> We are checking for solid braking and good overall handling.<br> <b>A:</b> I appreciate you helping me figure out what to look for.<br> <b>B:</b> My pleasure. This seems to be a solid car and a good choice for you.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I want to buy this used car, but I need help figuring out if  there are any problems with it.<br> <b>B:</b> I can help you with that. Drive the car over by the garage and we'll check it  out.<br> <b>A:</b> I know some things to look for, but I know there are other special things to  look for.<br> <b>B:</b> Always start with looking for signs of major damage that may have been  repaired and also check tire wear.<br> <b>A:</b> If the car has been in a major accident, that should have been recorded  online.<br> <b>B:</b> Right. All major accidents should have been recorded. Next start the car up,  pop the hood, and we'll take a look at the belts and hoses.<br> <b>A:</b> I would like for you to take a test drive with me.<br> <b>B:</b> We'll do that in a minute, but first we should check that the radio, turn  signals, and all of the lights work properly.<br> <b>A:</b> As we drive, what am I checking for?<br> <b>B:</b> You want to make sure that the alignment is good, that the engine accelerates  smoothly, and that the car can safely brake to a stop.<br> <b>A:</b> I like knowing what to look for when buying a used car and appreciate the  help.<br> <b>B:</b> This car is in good shape and should give you no major problems. Enjoy it!<br>
