				<h1>Buying a House</h1>
				<h2>Discussing Counter-Offer with a Realtor</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> Have the owners come up with a counter-offer to my offer to buy their  	home yet?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The owners have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand  	dollars.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Should I accept their offer?<br> 	<b>B:</b> There are two ways to respond. You can either come back with another  	offer or go with their counter-offer.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What if I make another offer, and they don't accept it?<br> 	<b>B:</b> No one else has made an offer, so you could make another offer if you  	want to do so.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that I would like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand  	dollars as a counter-offer.<br> 	<b>B:</b> OK, I will present your counter-offer to the owners tonight.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How long before I find out what their decision is?<br> 	<b>B:</b> By now, the owners probably have a pretty good idea of what they will  	accept. It will go quickly.<br> 	 <hr>        	<b>A:</b> Your office called and said that the owners had made a counter-offer to  	my offer to purchase their house.<br> 	<b>B:</b> To your offer of three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, the owners  	have counter-offered three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that maybe I should accept their offer.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You, of course, have two ways of responding. You can say yes or come up  	with another offer.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I want to make another offer, but I am afraid that they will decline and  	I will lose this house.<br> 	<b>B:</b> There is always a chance that someone could outbid you, but you could try  	one more offer if you like.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I would now like to offer three hundred and thirty thousand dollars as a  	counter-offer.<br> 	<b>B:</b> After the owners get home from work tonight, I will approach them with  	your offer.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can you tell me how long it will take them to get back to me?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I don't think that it will take as long as the response to the first  	offer.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to  	purchase the house?<br> 	<b>B:</b> In response to your offer, the sellers have decided to counter-offer  	three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars.<br> 	<b>A:</b> That sounds pretty good to me, but I am not sure what to do.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer.<br> 	<b>A:</b> If I make another offer and they refuse, then what?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Personally, I would consider making one more offer, but it is up to you  	to decide what to do.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Let's try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a  	counter-offer.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will contact the sellers with your current offer.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly  	than the first one.<br>
