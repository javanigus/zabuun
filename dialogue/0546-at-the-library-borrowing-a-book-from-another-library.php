I can't find any books on my research topic at my  library.<br> <b>B:</b> Why don't you try a different library?<br> <b>A:</b> I don't want to waste gas money.<br> <b>B:</b> But you might find your book.<br> <b>A:</b> What library do you suggest?<br> <b>B:</b> I suggest the one near my house.<br> <b>A:</b> That is way too far for me.<br> <b>B:</b> They have a lot of books. That library has never disappointed me.<br> <b>A:</b> I have an idea! Why don't you borrow them for me?<br> <b>B:</b> I don't know about that. What if you lose the books?<br> <b>A:</b> I won't.
