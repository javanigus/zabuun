				<h2>Moving Into a New Neighborhood</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I'm a bit nervous, Charlie.<br> <b>B:</b> Why, baby?<br> <b>A:</b> Well, you know, new neighborhood, new surroundings.<br> <b>B:</b> Change is good, Linda. Before long, you'll feel right at home.<br> <b>A:</b> I hope so. I guess I'm just used to the old place.<br> <b>B:</b> I know what you mean, baby, but this is a much better neighborhood.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, it is, but it's still something new.<br> <b>B:</b> We'll be fine. In a month it will feel like home.<br> <b>A:</b> I hope our neighbors are nice.<br> <b>B:</b> Me too, but that's not a deal-breaker. This is a much better place.<br> <b>A:</b> I know, dear. It's just my jitters, that's all.<br> <b>B:</b> We will get through this, babe.  </p>
