				<h2>A Medical Emergency</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> What seems to be the problem?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Oh, my God! It's my stomach. It's killing me!<br> 	<b>A:</b> Where does it hurt the most?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Right here! It hurts right here!<br> 	<b>A:</b> How long has it felt like this?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I felt OK when I woke up, and then, suddenly, I had this really sharp  	pain.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do you have a history of stomach pain?<br> 	<b>B:</b> No, and I haven't done anything out of the ordinary.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that we are going to have to get you to an emergency room  	right away.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Thank you for helping me.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> Can you tell me where it hurts?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am so glad they called you. It feels like something is really wrong  	with my stomach!<br> 	<b>A:</b> Does it hurt when I push here?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It's mostly on my right side. Right here!<br> 	<b>A:</b> Have you been feeling this way for awhile?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I started feeling kind of sick last night after dinner, but this morning  	the pain got really bad!<br> 	<b>A:</b> Have you eaten anything unusual lately?<br> 	<b>B:</b> No, not that I remember.<br> 	<b>A:</b> We are going to take you to an emergency room right now.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will feel better when I know what the problem is. Thank you.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> Where are you feeling the pain?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I can't stand up! My stomach is killing me!<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can you put your hand where it hurts the most?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It hurts smack in the middle of my gut!<br> 	<b>A:</b> Did this just come on suddenly?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I felt OK until an hour or so ago, and then I just doubled over.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Have you exercised strenuously or played sports recently?<br> 	<b>B:</b> No, and I don't usually get a lot of stomachaches.<br> 	<b>A:</b> We need to get you to an emergency room to see what the problem is.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I think that that is the best way to figure out what is causing this.  	Thank you.<br>
