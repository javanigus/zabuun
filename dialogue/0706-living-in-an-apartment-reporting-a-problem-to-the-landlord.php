				<h1>Living in an Apartment</h1>
				<h2>Reporting a Problem to the Landlord</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> The floor to my apartment is badly damaged.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry to hear that. How bad is it?<br> <b>A:</b> It's practically falling apart.<br> <b>B:</b> Did some kind of accident cause this?<br> <b>A:</b> None that I could've made. I think your previous tenant might have caused this.<br> <b>B:</b> That makes sense. He took poor care of the apartment.<br> <b>A:</b> I could see that myself.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll have that fixed as soon as possible.<br> <b>A:</b> If it's not too much trouble, may I request one more thing?<br> <b>B:</b> Is there anything else wrong in the apartment?<br> <b>A:</b> It's just my bedroom window. I can't seem to get it open.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll have that window taken care of as well.  </p>
