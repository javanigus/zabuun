				<h1>Selling a House</h1>
				<h2>Setting an Asking Price</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> How much do you think that I should ask for my house?<br> <b>B:</b> Well, there are a lot of factors involved in setting an asking price.<br> <b>A:</b> What do you look at when setting an asking price?<br> <b>B:</b> We need to look at the selling prices for similar homes in the area. These  will vary according to the condition of the home, specific location, and lot  size.<br> <b>A:</b> Do I have to use the comparisons as the asking price for my house?<br> <b>B:</b> No, but a seller is not going to be able to get a loan if the selling price  is a lot higher that what an appraiser feels the home is worth.<br> <b>A:</b> Isn't it better to price my house really high and see what I can get?<br> <b>B:</b> You shouldn't set the price of the house unrealistically high. Oftentimes  buyers are put off by this practice.<br> <b>A:</b> Can I change my mind and lower my price if the home doesn't sell?<br> <b>B:</b> Sure, you can always lower your asking price.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I am not sure what the asking price for my house should be.<br> <b>B:</b> We have to take in a number of factors in setting an asking price.<br> <b>A:</b> What do we need to consider in establishing an acceptable price for a home?<br> <b>B:</b> The comparisons to other similar homes in your area give us a good indication  of what your home is worth. <br> <b>A:</b> Is the price that we get by looking at comparisons necessarily the asking  price that I have to use for my home?<br> <b>B:</b> You don't have to use that particular asking price, but the buyer is going to  have trouble getting a loan if the house is priced too high.<br> <b>A:</b> Should I just shoot for the moon and, if I have to lower the price, do it  later?<br> <b>B:</b> You should be realistic in your pricing. Otherwise, many potential buyers  just walk away.<br> <b>A:</b> Can we lower the asking price later if we need to?<br> <b>B:</b> We can always re-evaluate the asking price in a few weeks, if we aren't  getting any offers.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> What do you think the asking price of my home should be?<br> <b>B:</b> There are many things to take into consideration when pricing a home.<br> <b>A:</b> What is involved in figuring out an asking price?<br> <b>B:</b> We need to combine many factors regarding your home to come up with an  accurate value for your home.<br> <b>A:</b> When you look at comparisons, do I necessarily have to ask that price?<br> <b>B:</b> You don't have to use the price from the comparisons as your asking price.  However, you must be realistic in what you ask.<br> <b>A:</b> I think that I am going to set the price really high so that I have room to  bargain with the buyers.<br> <b>B:</b> Don't go overboard in trying to get top dollar. More often than not, that  strategy backfires.<br> <b>A:</b> Is it okay to lower the asking price if the first price isn't bringing in any  offers?<br> <b>B:</b> If the market doesn't support your asking price, we can always re-evaluate  our pricing and adjust it.<br>
