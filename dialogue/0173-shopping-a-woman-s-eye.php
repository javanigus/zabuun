How may I help you?<br> <b>A:</b> I want to buy my wife a new scarf.<br> <b>B:</b> That is very thoughtful of you!<br> <b>A:</b> Her favorite color is blue, so I chose blue scarves.<br> <b>B:</b> What do you need me to do?<br> <b>A:</b> Well, I was wondering which scarf was the prettiest.<br> <b>B:</b> I see. Well, this one seems a little too dark.<br> <b>A:</b> What about this one?<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe something with a nicer pattern.<br> <b>A:</b> Is this one alright?<br> <b>B:</b> That one is perfect! I'm sure she'll love it.  </p>
