				<h2>Being Absent</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Why were you absent yesterday?<br> <b>B:</b> Why do you care?<br> <b>A:</b> You should be thankful I care so much about your education.<br> <b>B:</b> The truth is, I didn't hear the alarm clock.<br> <b>A:</b> You missed out on a very important lecture.<br> <b>B:</b> It happens. I'll just ask my friend what was on the lecture.<br> <b>A:</b> Is she a good note taker?<br> <b>B:</b> I don't know. I guess?<br> <b>A:</b> If you were in class, you wouldn't have to rely on anyone's notes.<br> <b>B:</b> I can't change the past.<br> <b>A:</b> I know. Anyways, you should increase the volume on your alarm clock.<br> <b>B:</b> I suppose I could do that.  </p>
