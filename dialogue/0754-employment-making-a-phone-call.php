				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hi! How are you?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm doing good. How are you?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm great, but a little nervous.<br> <b>B:</b> Why is that?<br> <b>A:</b> I have a phone interview for a job in an hour.<br> <b>B:</b> A phone interview? That's great!<br> <b>A:</b> It is, but I'm convinced I'm going to mess it up.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, you shouldn't say that. You'll be fine.<br> <b>A:</b> I wish I had your confidence.<br> <b>B:</b> Just relax, and be yourself. A phone interview is easier than in person.<br> <b>A:</b> That's right. I wasn't looking at it that way.<br> <b>B:</b> Be yourself. Don't pretend to be anyone else, and you'll do well.  </p>
