				<h1>Taking the Bus</h1>
				<h2>Complaining about a Late bus (2)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> How long have we've been waiting for this bus?<br> <b>B:</b> Almost one hour. I think it's late.<br> <b>A:</b> It is late! What is taking this bus driver so long to get here?<br> <b>B:</b> Probably traffic. You know how traffic could be on the weekends.<br> <b>A:</b> That is not a good excuse. Bus drivers should know how to maneuver past traffic.<br> <b>B:</b> That's easy for you to say.<br> <b>A:</b> I just want the bus to arrive already. I want to go home.<br> <b>B:</b> It's bound to arrive any minute now.<br> <b>A:</b> I hope you're right. My patience has all extinguished.<br> <b>B:</b> Wait. I think I see it coming in the distance!<br> <b>A:</b> Thank goodness! I couldn't possibly wait another minute.<br> <b>B:</b> False alarm. It was just a truck. Sorry about that.  </p>
