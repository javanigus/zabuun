				<h2>Tiger Books</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hi, can you help me find a book on tigers?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, of course. Is it for a school project?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I'm doing an essay on the life of a tiger.<br> <b>B:</b> You're going to want one with a lot of words and less pictures.<br> <b>A:</b> But I want the one with pictures!<br> <b>B:</b> Pictures are pretty, but they won't help you with your essay that much.<br> <b>A:</b> Fine, I admit you're right.<br> <b>B:</b> You can borrow the book with pictures for your own pleasure.<br> <b>A:</b> Yay! I love tigers.<br> <b>B:</b> I have a book that isn't hard to understand, but still has great information.<br> <b>A:</b> Great! You're so helpful.<br> <b>B:</b> It's my job to be helpful.  </p>
