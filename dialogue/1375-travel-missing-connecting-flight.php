				<h2>Missing Connecting Flight</h2>
				               <b>A:</b> My flight just arrived late, and I need to know what to do.<br> 	<b>B:</b> That's okay. The airline computer is keeping track of what is happening  	with you.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Do I have to call anyone?<br> 	<b>B:</b> By speaking with us at the arrival gate, we can fix the problem for you  	and direct you.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What if there are no more connecting flights for today on this airline?<br> 	<b>B:</b> We will go online to see if there is something available with this  	airline. If we need to, we can check for a flight with another carrier.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What if I can't find another flight out of here tonight?<br> 	<b>B:</b> We can help you find transportation to a local hotel.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Will the airline pay for my room if I have to spend the night at the  	airport?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Since the flight delay was our fault and you are continuing on with our  	airline, we will cover the cost of a hotel room.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> Our flight was late, and I missed my connecting flight.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We can help you find an alternate flight that will get you where you are  	going.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Whom should I call?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The arrival gate is where you need to find someone to help you. You are  	in the right place.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think the flight we missed was the last flight out of here today.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We can go on the computer to try to find an alternate flight on another  	airline if we cannot accommodate you.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What if I get stuck here and can't get out of this airport?<br> 	<b>B:</b> There is a shuttle that is still running and can take you into town to a  	hotel.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I don't have any money for a hotel room.<br> 	<b>B:</b> The flight that you missed is not with our airline, and we would not have  	suggested booking the flights so close together. We won't pay for your hotel  	room.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> I had a connecting flight, but our arriving flight was late.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We will help you make alternative plans.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can you give me the number of the airline so that I can call?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The airlines always have personnel at the arrival gate to help direct you  	when a flight is late. We can help you right here.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I remember that when we booked this flight, our connecting flight was the  	only one on this day.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Our ticketing is tied in with other airlines. If we cannot accommodate  	you, perhaps another airline has some open seats to your destination.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Where will I stay if I can't get another flight tonight?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Since I believe there is a flight out of here at 5:45 in the morning, you  	may want to consider just staying at the airport.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I don't think I should have to pay for a hotel room.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We will pay 50 percent of the price of your room.<br>
