				<h2>Asking for More Amenities</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> There are some amenities missing from my hotel room.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm so sorry to hear that. What is your room number and what's missing?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm in room 143; there is no hairdryer.<br> <b>B:</b> I can send one up to you right away.<br> <b>A:</b> Great! So that I can use that hairdryer, can you also send up shampoo and conditioner?<br> <b>B:</b> There should have been a basket in the bathroom with all that.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, there isn't.<br> <b>B:</b> Anything else I can send up to your room?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, I need an iron and an ironing board.<br> <b>B:</b> Those aren't in your closet?<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe they are invisible. I don't see them.<br> <b>B:</b> I do apologize. I'll bring them personally.  </p>
