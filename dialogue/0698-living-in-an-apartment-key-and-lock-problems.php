				<h2>Key and Lock Problems (2)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Help, please. My key won't open the front door to my apartment.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, no. Let me try to help you.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you, but I don't think there's much you can do.<br> <b>B:</b> Don't be so pessimistic. I'll help you unlock that door.<br> <b>A:</b> I already tried using the key. There's no use in trying anymore.<br> <b>B:</b> I have another idea. Care to hear it?<br> <b>A:</b> Alright, I don't have any other options.<br> <b>B:</b> Let me drive you to a locksmith.<br> <b>A:</b> What good will that do?<br> <b>B:</b> A locksmith can replace your key. The one you have now is probably broken.<br> <b>A:</b> It's worth a try, I guess.<br> <b>B:</b> There's the spirit! Come on, let's go.  </p>
