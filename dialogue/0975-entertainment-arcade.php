				<p>  <b>A:</b> I love playing all of these old fashioned games!<br> <b>B:</b> Me, too! Too bad it's so expensive.<br> <b>A:</b> I wish they'd cost nickels instead of quarters.<br> <b>B:</b> I think that would lose the arcade a lot of money.<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe, but it would get them a lot of new customers.<br> <b>B:</b> Despite the high cost, these games are a lot of fun.<br> <b>A:</b> Look at these old graphics!<br> <b>B:</b> It's funny to think they were once considered high-tech.<br> <b>A:</b> I used to be really good at this game when I was a kid.<br> <b>B:</b> My brother and I used to compete all the time.<br> <b>A:</b> Let's see who gets a higher score!<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe tomorrow. I'm already out of quarters.  </p>
