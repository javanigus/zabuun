				<p>  <b>A:</b> Oh no! I lost my ticket!<br> <b>B:</b> Was it an all-day pass?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes! I just bought it!<br> <b>B:</b> What are you going to do?<br> <b>A:</b> Well, I guess all I need to do is get home.<br> <b>B:</b> It takes three transfers to get to your house.<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe I'll just hop the bus.<br> <b>B:</b> No way! You have to buy another ticket!<br> <b>A:</b> It's not a big deal. No one will notice.<br> <b>B:</b> You'd better not. You could get in trouble.<br> <b>A:</b> I feel like I'm wasting my money!<br> <b>B:</b> A $2 ticket is better than a $150 ticket fine.  </p>
