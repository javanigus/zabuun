				<h2>How to prepare for an Interview</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I was hoping you could help me.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll try. What help do you need?<br> <b>A:</b> I'm having an interview tomorrow morning. I'm very nervous.<br> <b>B:</b> That's great! Why are you nervous though?<br> <b>A:</b> I don't do well in interviews.<br> <b>B:</b> They can be frightening, but you can do it.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm afraid they'll ask me something I won't know.<br> <b>B:</b> You should prepare yourself. Go online, and look at their website.<br> <b>A:</b> Now why didn't I think of that?<br> <b>B:</b> It's a good idea to know everything you can about them first.<br> <b>A:</b> That's an excellent idea! Thanks.<br> <b>B:</b> You're welcome. If you need more help, give me a call.  </p>
