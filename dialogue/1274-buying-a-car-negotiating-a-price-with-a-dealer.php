				<h1>Buying a Car</h1>
				<h2>Negotiating a Price with a Dealer</h2>
				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> How much does this car cost?<br> <b>B:</b> Well, come on in and we'll sit down and discuss that right now. How much do  you want to pay?<br> <b>A:</b> I really was just wondering what the price is.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, figuring in tax, license, dealer prep, and registration, I can let this  car go for fifteen thousand dollars.<br> <b>A:</b> I was thinking a little lower than that.<br> <b>B:</b> Whoa! Let's keep talking here. I am sure we can work something out. What  price are you thinking is fair?<br> <b>A:</b> I was thinking more like thirteen thousand dollars.<br> <b>B:</b> You know, you look like you are a sweet kid. I'll give it to you for fourteen  thousand dollars.<br> <b>A:</b> That would be a good price if the car was in great shape, but it is  registered as having been in an accident.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty, and that's my final offer.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> If I want to buy this car, what will it cost me?<br> <b>B:</b> Let me get my contract out, and we'll figure that out for you right now.<br> <b>A:</b> Can't you just tell me what it costs?<br> <b>B:</b> You know, I am prepared to offer you a great deal today on that car. With  tax, license, registration, and dealer prep, the total will be fifteen thousand  dollars.<br> <b>A:</b> Fine, I'll come back later with my father, who is a lawyer, and we can talk  then.<br> <b>B:</b> I am sure that we can work something out. What price were you thinking would  be a good deal for you?<br> <b>A:</b> Thirteen thousand would be more like it.<br> <b>B:</b> Fourteen thousand for this car is a good price. For that I am practically  giving it away.<br> <b>A:</b> Normally that would be a good price, but that car has been in an accident.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I see your point. Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final  offer.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> How much money for this car?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, that car is beautiful, isn't it? Come on inside and we'll discuss the  price.<br> <b>A:</b> I just want to know the price.<br> <b>B:</b> Fifteen thousand out the door! What a deal! That will, of course, include  tax, license, registration, and dealer prep.<br> <b>A:</b> I appreciate your help, and I'll see you later.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, you look like a smart person. What price would be fair to you?<br> <b>A:</b> I think that thirteen thousand would be fair for this car.<br> <b>B:</b> I can see that you are a smart buyer. Fourteen thousand is my best price.<br> <b>A:</b> If the car hadn't been in an accident, that would be a good price, but it has  a few minor problems.<br> <b>B:</b> Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer.<br>
