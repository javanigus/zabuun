				<h1>Renting an Apartment</h1>
				<h2>Eviction Notice</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> I received an eviction notice from you, and I don't understand what it  	means.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Well, you are behind in your rent; it's a 30-day notice to vacate.<br> 	<b>A:</b> You can't make me move just for being late with my rent.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You have been late with your rent several times now. I am filing suit for  	back rent to protect myself.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Are you throwing me out?<br> 	<b>B:</b> This notice is to let you know that you will be evicted by a sheriff if  	you don't make good on your rent.<br> 	<b>A:</b> If I catch up on my rent, can I stay?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can stay if you catch up and stay caught up. Otherwise, I will find  	another renter.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I will go get the money right now.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Thank you. Please make sure that you pay with cash or a cashier's check.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I opened my mail, found this eviction notice, and don't know what to do  	with it.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Actually, it is a 30-day notice to vacate the premises.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Just for being a few days late?<br> 	<b>B:</b> This isn't the first time you have been considerably late with the rent.  	I need to start the procedure to evict you.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Are you taking my apartment away?<br> 	<b>B:</b> This is a notice to inform you that the sheriff will evict you in 30 days  	if you do not pay up on your rent.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Can I keep the apartment if I pay my rent in full?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can keep the apartment if you stay caught up on your rent. Otherwise,  	I need to find someone who can make the payments.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I will go write a check right now.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Thank you. I will need a cashier's check or cash, please.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> What is this eviction notice for?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The notice you received is a 30-day notice to vacate.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Are you kidding me?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I mentioned to you before that you need to keep up with your rent. This  	notice to evict is letting you know that I mean business.<br> 	<b>A:</b> You can't just throw me out on the street!<br> 	<b>B:</b> You have 30 days to catch up on your rent, or a sheriff will evict you.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Will you still throw me out if I make the rent payment?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can stay, but you might think about looking for a less expensive  	living arrangement if you are having trouble making the payments.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am going to take care of the rent payment right now.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Thank you. The payment needs to be in the form of cash or a cashier's  	check.<br>
