				<h2>Giving an Excuse for Being Late to Work</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Good morning, Peterson Industries.<br> <b>B:</b> Hello, Betty. This is Roger.<br> <b>A:</b> Hey, Roger. Where are you?<br> <b>B:</b> I am stuck on the 60 freeway. I'm going to be late for work.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, no. Any traffic accident happened?<br> <b>B:</b> I really don't know, Betty. All I know is that traffic is crawling.<br> <b>A:</b> I will tell your supervisor you called in late.<br> <b>B:</b> That would be great, but I could tell him myself.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, normally that would be okay, but he's stuck in the same traffic jam.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh no! Really? Okay.<br> <b>A:</b> At least he'll know your excuse is true!<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. Thank you. See you soon.  </p>
