				    <b>A:</b> Hello, Nicole? This is Jimmy in 309.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hello, Jimmy. What's up? <br>   <b>A:</b> You're not going to believe this.<br>   <b>B:</b> Believe me, I think I've heard everything.<br>   <b>A:</b> I can't find my mailbox key.<br>   <b>B:</b> Is that all? That's a lot better than losing your car keys.<br>   <b>A:</b> I had a duplicate, but I can't find it either.<br>   <b>B:</b> If you come by my place, I can loan you a key.<br>   <b>A:</b> There's no emergency. All I get is junk mail and bills.<br>   <b>B:</b> Can you wait till Wednesday? I'll make you two more keys.<br>   <b>A:</b> Sure, that'll be fine.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay. I'll see you Wednesday. But it's going to cost you $2 per key.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Can I speak to Nicole? This is Jimmy in apartment 309.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's happening?<br>   <b>A:</b> You probably never heard this one before.<br>   <b>B:</b> Don't bet on it. I've been an apartment manager for a long time.<br>   <b>A:</b> I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once.<br>   <b>A:</b> To make matters worse, I can't find my duplicate either.<br>   <b>B:</b> If you want, come over here and I'll lend you a key.<br>   <b>A:</b> No, there's nothing vital in the mailbox. Just junk and bills.<br>   <b>B:</b> If you can wait until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you.<br>   <b>A:</b> Wednesday's fine. <br>   <b>B:</b> Okay, I'll bring them by Wednesday. Have $4 ready for me.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hi, Nicole. This is Jimmy in 309.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hello, Jimmy. Can I help you?<br>   <b>A:</b> I've got a little problem.<br>   <b>B:</b> Tell me your problem, and maybe I can help.<br>   <b>A:</b> I've looked everywhere, but I can't find my mailbox key.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, that's pretty minor. I lost my car keys and house keys once.<br>   <b>A:</b> As if that wasn't bad enough, I also misplaced the duplicate.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, if it's an emergency, come by here and I'll lend you a key.<br>   <b>A:</b> No, even if there's a bill in there, it can wait.<br>   <b>B:</b> If you don't mind waiting until Wednesday, I'll make two more keys for you.<br>   <b>A:</b> Oh, I can wait, believe me.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay, see you Wednesday. They're not free, you know. It'll be $4.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hey, Nicole. It's Jimmy in 309.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hi there, Jimmy. What can I do for you?<br>   <b>A:</b> I screwed up, and I need your help.<br>   <b>B:</b> Tell me the specific problem. Let me see what I can do.<br>   <b>A:</b> I've torn my apartment apart, but I can't find my mailbox key.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, you should be grateful it wasn't your car keys.<br>   <b>A:</b> On top of that, I couldn't find the duplicate either.<br>   <b>B:</b> If you need to get in there, come by and borrow a key.<br>   <b>A:</b> No, my mailbox is usually empty anyway.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, then, I'll make you two more keys on Wednesday.<br>   <b>A:</b> No problem. I can wait till Wednesday. Maybe there'll be something in there    by then.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay. Have $4 ready for when you see me Wednesday.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hello? This is Jimmy in 309.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hi, Jimmy. This is Nicole. What's going on?<br>   <b>A:</b> Maybe you can get me out of a small jam.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, I can certainly try.<br>   <b>A:</b> Somehow, I managed to lose my mailbox key.<br>   <b>B:</b> Believe me, losing a mailbox key is a lot better than losing your car keys.<br>   <b>A:</b> I've got a duplicate somewhere, but I haven't been able to find it either.<br>   <b>B:</b> If you absolutely can't wait, come over here and borrow a key.<br>   <b>A:</b> No, I doubt that there's anything important in my mailbox, if there's    anything at all.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, if there's no emergency, I can make you two more keys on Wednesday.<br>   <b>A:</b> Not a problem. All my fan mail can wait till then.<br>   <b>B:</b> Okay, see you Wednesday. Have $4 for me, and I'll give you a receipt.<br>
