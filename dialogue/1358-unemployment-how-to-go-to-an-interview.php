What else should I keep in mind?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Just relax, listen carefully to the questions, and be honest in your  	responses.<br>  <hr>                <b>A:</b> Is this the workshop to prepare for an interview?<br> 	<b>B:</b> This is the interview class.

What do  	you think are some important considerations going into your interview?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I think that we should dress neatly and appropriately.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Yes. Second, as you can imagine, attitude and friendliness go a long way.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Yes, and I always feel much better when I am friendly.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Believe it or not, the interviewers are as interested in your questions  	as they are in your answers.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Any more hints as to what I should do in an interview?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Always be honest with your answers. The interviewers really do want to  	know if you will be a good fit for them.<br>  <hr>                 <b>A:</b> I was trying to find the class on preparing for interviews.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You have found your way to the interview class. Please come in!<br> 	<b>A:</b> I am so happy I found this class because I was really nervous about my  	upcoming interview.<br> 	<b>B:</b> When we go into an interview, what do you think our first consideration  	should be?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Our dress and grooming are probably the first thing an interviewer judges  	us by.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Friendliness and a good attitude are also very important.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Yes, and they help establish a friendly tone for the rest of the  	interview.<br> 	<b>B:</b> The interviewers always are interested in what you ask them about their  	company.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What else should I be thinking about?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Be yourself and be honest.
