I've heard so many good things about it.<br> <b>A:</b> Did you make an appointment?<br> <b>B:</b> No, it wasn't necessary. They're enrolling new students this week.<br> <b>A:</b> Okay, I just hope there're not too many people.<br> <b>B:</b> I think we'll be okay. There're not too many cars in the lot.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm glad we brought her transcripts. I think that will make this smoother.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I'm sure it will. That was a good idea.<br> <b>A:</b> Okay, let's get this done.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm ready, babe.  </p>
