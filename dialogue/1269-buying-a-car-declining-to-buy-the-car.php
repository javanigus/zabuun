				<h1>Buying a Car</h1>
				<h2>Declining to Buy the Car</h2>
				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> Thank you for letting me test drive the car.<br> <b>B:</b> So do you think that you would like to purchase this car?<br> <b>A:</b> You know, I am not interested in purchasing the car right now.<br> <b>B:</b> What's the problem? We can at least sit down and maybe work out a deal.<br> <b>A:</b> Actually, I have several other cars to look at before I make my decision.<br> <b>B:</b> What didn't you like about the car? Maybe I can fix something for you.<br> <b>A:</b> It is a combination of things, but I appreciate your time.<br> <b>B:</b> I have some other cars you might want to look at.<br> <b>A:</b> Again, I appreciate your time but I will not be purchasing this car.<br> <b>B:</b> Give me a call if you change your mind. Have a good day.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I appreciate you letting me take the car out for a spin.<br> <b>B:</b> Why don't you come over here and we can work out the details of the purchase?<br> <b>A:</b> I don't think that this is the car for me at this point in time.<br> <b>B:</b> It's a great deal. Let's talk price. Maybe you'll change your mind.<br> <b>A:</b> This is only the first car that I've looked at.<br> <b>B:</b> Is there something in particular that didn't look good to you?<br> <b>A:</b> It isn't one thing in particular, but I think I can do better for my money.<br> <b>B:</b> I really think that you should reconsider.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you again for your time.<br> <b>B:</b> Thank you for stopping by. Good luck in your search for a car.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I enjoyed taking the car out for a test drive.<br> <b>B:</b> Isn't that a great car? Let's work out the details of purchase.<br> <b>A:</b> I will not be purchasing the car today.<br> <b>B:</b> Why don't you take a second look at that car? You'll see that it is as good a  deal as you are going to get.<br> <b>A:</b> I need to compare this car to others to make an informed choice.<br> <b>B:</b> You said on the phone that this is the kind of car you wanted. What has  changed your mind?<br> <b>A:</b> I just really need to make sure that I get the best car for my money.<br> <b>B:</b> You know, you can look around but I just don't think that you are going to  get a better deal for your money.<br> <b>A:</b> I will continue looking around for cars and will get back to you if I change  my mind.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, then. Have a good day.<br>
