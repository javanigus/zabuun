				Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I would like to order some internet today.<br> <b>B:</b> What kind would you like?<br> <b>A:</b> What kind of internet is there?<br> <b>B:</b> You can get DSL or dial-up.<br> <b>A:</b> Which of those two is best?<br> <b>B:</b> I would recommend DSL.<br> <b>A:</b> Is that one better?<br> <b>B:</b> It's better because it doesn't tie up your phone.<br> <b>A:</b> What do you mean by that?<br> <b>B:</b> DSL isn't connected through your phone line, but dial-up is.<br> <b>A:</b> So then I can't use my phone if I'm on the internet?<br> <b>B:</b> That's correct. With DSL you can do both.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I need to get internet.<br> <b>B:</b> Which kind of internet connection do you want to get?<br> <b>A:</b> What kind can I get?<br> <b>B:</b> There is dial-up or DSL.<br> <b>A:</b> Which one do you feel is best?<br> <b>B:</b> I would get DSL if I were you.<br> <b>A:</b> DSL is better than dial-up?<br> <b>B:</b> It's the best choice; plus, it won't tie up your phone line.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm not sure what that means.<br> <b>B:</b> Dial-up is connected through your phone, unlike DSL.<br> <b>A:</b> That'll make it impossible for me to use.<br> <b>B:</b> Exactly. With DSL you don't have that problem.<br>  <hr>       Repeat <br>  <b>A:</b> I'd like to have internet on my computer.<br> <b>B:</b> Do you know what kind of internet you would like to get?<br> <b>A:</b> What are my options?<br> <b>B:</b> You can either get dial-up or DSL.<br> <b>A:</b> Which one would you recommend?<br> <b>B:</b> DSL is the best choice.<br> <b>A:</b> Why is DSL better?<br> <b>B:</b> It's a lot better because it doesn't tie up your phone line.<br> <b>A:</b> What exactly does that mean?<br> <b>B:</b> Well, with dial-up your internet is connected by your phone line.<br> <b>A:</b> That means that I can't use my phone and the internet at the same time,  right?<br> <b>B:</b> That's right. You won't have that problem with DSL.<br>
