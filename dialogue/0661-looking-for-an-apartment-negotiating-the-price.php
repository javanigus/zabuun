				<h1>Looking for an Apartment</h1>
				<h2>Negotiating the Price (1)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> It's a nice apartment.<br> <b>B:</b> I knew you would like it. Who wouldn't?<br> <b>A:</b> There is only one issue.<br> <b>B:</b> What is it? Is it the next door neighbor?<br> <b>A:</b> No, he's great. I was talking about the price.<br> <b>B:</b> What about the price? It's a fair price, if I do say so myself.<br> <b>A:</b> I think it's a little too high for me. Is there anything you can do for me?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm not sure if I can.<br> <b>A:</b> Listen, I would be the perfect tenant.<br> <b>B:</b> And how is that?<br> <b>A:</b> Well, I always make my payments on time. You can check my credit score.<br> <b>B:</b> Alright, that's good to hear.<br> <b>A:</b> I sleep early, and am very respectable. I also have no pets.<br> <b>B:</b> I think I've heard enough. You sound like a good tenant. I'm going to reduce the monthly rent by $100.  </p>
