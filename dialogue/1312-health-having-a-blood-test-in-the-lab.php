				<h2>Having a Blood Test in the Lab</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> The doctor sent me over here to have my blood drawn.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Certainly, please have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What is this test for?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Well, today your doctor wants us to check your white blood cell count.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What does that tell him?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Well, if it is elevated, you might have an infection.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Will the blood test hurt?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is only a little pin stick. I am going to put a tourniquet on your arm  	to puff your veins up.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Ouch!<br> 	<b>B:</b> There we go! I got the blood that I needed.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> My doctor says that I need a blood test.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I can help you with that. Just have a seat and roll up your left sleeve.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What are you taking my blood for?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Your doctor has requested a check of your white blood count.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What information does that give him?<br> 	<b>B:</b> If your white blood cell count is off, it could signal an infection  	somewhere in your body.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Is a blood test painful?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am putting a tourniquet on your arm to plump up the vein. It will only  	feel like a little pin prick.<br> 	<b>A:</b> My God, that hurts!<br> 	<b>B:</b> That was it! Thank you for coming in today.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I came to this lab to have my blood drawn.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You are in the right place. Roll up your left sleeve and have a seat.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What am I being tested for?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is.<br> 	<b>A:</b> What does my white blood cell count tell him?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Usually if your white count is off, the doctor suspects an infection.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How much will it hurt?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is only a pin prick. I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make  	the vein easier to find.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Is that my blood going into that tube?<br> 	<b>B:</b> That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed. Thanks for  	coming in!<br>
