				<p>  <b>A:</b> I didn't like the way you sang tonight.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, wow. Well, thanks for coming out.<br> <b>A:</b> You didn't put in all your effort. That's all I'm saying.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, well I'm going to leave now.<br> <b>A:</b> Why are you in a rush to leave?<br> <b>B:</b> Because you are being rude, and I don't want to speak to you.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, now I know you can't take criticism.<br> <b>B:</b> It's not that I can't take criticism; it's that I don't like jerks.<br> <b>A:</b> How am I a jerk? I'm just giving you my honest opinion.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, in my honest opinion, I don't care what you think.<br> <b>A:</b> Now, that was rude. I don't want to talk to you anymore.<br> <b>B:</b> Great. Believe me; I won't be losing any sleep.  </p>
