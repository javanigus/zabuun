				<h2>Turning Homework in Late</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> May I turn in my homework tomorrow?<br> <b>B:</b> It's due today.<br> <b>A:</b> I know, but I don't have it right now.<br> <b>B:</b> How come? Your dog ate it?<br> <b>A:</b> No! I left it at home.<br> <b>B:</b> I can't take your word for it.<br> <b>A:</b> Why not? I'm an A+ student.<br> <b>B:</b> How do I know if you even did the homework?<br> <b>A:</b> I'll ask my mom to take a picture of it and send it to me.<br> <b>B:</b> That's fair enough.<br> <b>A:</b> Thanks. Also, you should try trusting students more. We're not all that bad.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll try, but I can't promise anything.  </p>
