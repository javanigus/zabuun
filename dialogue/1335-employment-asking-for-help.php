Should this party be formal or casual?<br> <b>A:</b> I think it should be casual.<br> <b>B:</b> I agree. Next, we have to decide on food. We have a choice of Chinese or  Continental Cuisine. Which one should we have?<br> <b>A:</b> I would prefer Chinese food for this party.<br> <b>B:</b> Perfect choice. For music, should we have a live band or a DJ?<br> <b>A:</b> I think we should hire a live band.<br> <b>B:</b> OK then. Well, I will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on  Friday.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I need help with the office party.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, of course. We could split it. What part would you like to do, the food  or the entertainment?<br> <b>A:</b> I have no idea what the entertainment should be.<br> <b>B:</b> Let's make sure we are on the same page.

What kind of music would you like, a band or recorded  music?<br> <b>A:</b> We should bring in a really good DJ.<br> <b>B:</b> That works for me.

What would you like me to help with, food or  entertainment?<br> <b>A:</b> I would like to help you with both.<br> <b>B:</b> That will work out fine. To make sure everything goes together, do you think  this party should be casual or dressy?<br> <b>A:</b> A dressy party would be fun!<br> <b>B:</b> That will work out fine. Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would  be best?<br> <b>A:</b> We should probably have both.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, that will work out fine. Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ?<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe we could do both!<br> <b>B:</b> Everything sounds great then! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss  the details.<br>
