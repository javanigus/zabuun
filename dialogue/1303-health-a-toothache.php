I have a really bad pain in my tooth!<br> 	<b>A:</b> How long have you had this toothache?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It bothers me off and on, but it's gotten much worse these past few  	weeks.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Is there anything that you've done to your tooth that might have caused  	the pain?<br> 	<b>B:</b> My girlfriend told me that I grind my teeth a lot when I sleep. Maybe  	that is the problem.<br> 	<b>A:</b> When you brush your teeth, what do you use?<br> 	<b>B:</b> I use a soft bristle toothbrush.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Does it bother you when you have to chew a lot?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Absolutely. That set it off big time!<br>
