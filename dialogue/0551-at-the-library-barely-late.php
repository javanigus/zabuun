The late fee is $5.<br> <b>A:</b> Okay, I'm only one minute late.<br> <b>B:</b> One minute late, one month late, one year late, it doesn't matter.<br> <b>A:</b> Are you kidding me? There's a big difference between one minute and one  month.<br> <b>B:</b> Look, the point is - they're late.<br> <b>A:</b> Screw you! I ain't payin $5.<br> <b>B:</b> I guess you'll never borrow another book, magazine, or video here ever again.<br> <b>A:</b> It's okay, because I don't even like this library.<br> <b>B:</b> This library doesn't like you either!<br> <b>A:</b> I am leaving!
