				  <b>A:</b> So tell me again, why couldn't you get the supplies I  ordered?<br> <b>B:</b> Well I ordered them when you asked, but the supplier said they might  need to back order them.<br> <b>A:</b> When do you think they will finally arrive?<br> <b>B:</b> I think maybe by Tuesday.<br> <b>A:</b> If they don't arrive by then, what are our options?<br> <b>B:</b> I could try another supplier down the street.<br> <b>A:</b> That would work for me.<br> <b>B:</b> OK, I will stay on it and let you know how it's going.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you for taking care of the problem.<br> <b>B:</b> Thank you for your business. We appreciate you as a client.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> You promised me the supplies would be in today and now you  say they aren't here?<br> <b>B:</b> They said they had part of the order, but the rest won't be available until  later.<br> <b>A:</b> I guess that's it then, when will you be able to get the rest?<br> <b>B:</b> I am not sure.<br> <b>A:</b> I am not convinced that will work for me, what now?<br> <b>B:</b> I could order them from another supplier as a back-up.<br> <b>A:</b> That is a good plan.<br> <b>B:</b> Good! I will call you later this afternoon and let you know when your  supplies will arrive.<br> <b>A:</b> I appreciate you staying on it.<br> <b>B:</b> We appreciate your business and aim to please.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I really needed the supplies today and you are telling me you  don't have them?<br> <b>B:</b> The supplier said that it will be a few more days until they can ship the  order.<br> <b>A:</b> Fine, what day will the whole order be here?<br> <b>B:</b> If we are lucky, they may get here tomorrow.<br> <b>A:</b> Is there anywhere else we can get these supplies?<br> <b>B:</b> Let's order the missing items from someone else just to be sure.<br> <b>A:</b> I appreciate that suggestion.<br> <b>B:</b> I will track your order on the internet and e-mail you the moment it arrives.<br> <b>A:</b> I look forward to hearing from you.<br> <b>B:</b> Please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you in the  meantime.<br>
