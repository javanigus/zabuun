				<p>  <b>A:</b> what are you doing on Friday night?<br> <b>B:</b> I was just going to stay in and watch a movie on Netflix.<br> <b>A:</b> How about you let me take you out to a movie?<br> <b>B:</b> That would be really nice.<br> <b>A:</b> We could even grab a bite to eat afterwards.<br> <b>B:</b> I would really like that.<br> <b>A:</b> Great! If I pick you up at 6 p.m., would that work?<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah, that gives me time to change after work.<br> <b>A:</b> Can I have your phone number so I can call when I'm on my way?<br> <b>B:</b> That's a great idea. And you should give me your number, too.<br> <b>A:</b> Okay, I'm really looking forward to Friday.<br> <b>B:</b> We're going to have a really nice time.  </p>
