				<p>  <b>A:</b> Have you seen my mailbox key lying around somewhere?<br> <b>B:</b> No, I'm sorry. Where did you last leave it?<br> <b>A:</b> I thought it was in my pocket.<br> <b>B:</b> Is that where you last put it?<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, I'm pretty sure.<br> <b>B:</b> Think hard. Where was it before you supposedly put in your pocket?<br> <b>A:</b> I was in my apartment cleaning out the kitchen.<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe you emptied your pockets while you were cleaning.<br> <b>A:</b> Wait! I think I did empty my pockets!<br> <b>B:</b> There you go. I knew it.<br> <b>A:</b> I remember now. My keys are on the kitchen counter.<br> <b>B:</b> That's a relief.  </p>
