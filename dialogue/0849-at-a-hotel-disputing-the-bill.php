				<h2>Disputing the Bill</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> There are some charges on the final bill that are incorrect.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, sir. Can you tell me which ones are in dispute?<br> <b>A:</b> I never ordered this movie "The Care Bears Christmas."<br> <b>B:</b> Are you sure your kids didn't order it?<br> <b>A:</b> I don't have any kids. Besides I was at the theater at that time.<br> <b>B:</b> All right, I'll take that charge off your bill. Anything else?<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, I didn't drink 4 bottles of Grey Goose from the minibar.<br> <b>B:</b> I remember you calling for more vodka, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah I ordered three more bottles, but I didn't drink any of them.<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe you don't remember drinking the additional three bottles?<br> <b>A:</b> What are you trying to say, that I'm an alcoholic?<br> <b>B:</b> No, sir. I'm just reading what is in our system.  </p>
