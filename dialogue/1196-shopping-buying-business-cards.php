				<h2>Buying Business Cards</h2>
				   <b>A:</b> I would like to buy some business cards.<br> <b>B:</b> Excellent. How many would you like?<br> <b>A:</b> Two thousand would be fine.<br> <b>B:</b> You need to fill out this form, please.<br> <b>A:</b> All I want is the same thing on this card.<br> <b>B:</b> That will be no problem, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm finished. Here's your form and my old card.<br> <b>B:</b> Very good, sir. Your order will be ready in one week.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you think you could finish it in three days?<br> <b>B:</b> No problem, sir. But it will cost you extra.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I need to purchase some business cards.<br> <b>B:</b> No problem. How many are you thinking about?<br> <b>A:</b> I think 2,000 would be fine.<br> <b>B:</b> If you'll just fill out this form, please.<br> <b>A:</b> I want the new cards to be exactly like this card.<br> <b>B:</b> We can do that very easily.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm done. Here's the form and my old card.<br> <b>B:</b> Great. Your order will take only one week.<br> <b>A:</b> You know, I think it would be better if I could pick it up in three days.<br> <b>B:</b> We can do that. It'll just cost you extra.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I need to get some business cards printed up.<br> <b>B:</b> Do you know how many you need?<br> <b>A:</b> I think I can get by with 2,000.<br> <b>B:</b> We can get started as soon as you fill out this form.<br> <b>A:</b> I hope you can make the new cards just like my old cards.<br> <b>B:</b> You won't be able to tell the difference with a magnifying glass.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm through. Here's the form and my old card.<br> <b>B:</b> Very good. You can pick up your order in one week.<br> <b>A:</b> Now that I think of it, three days is better than seven.<br> <b>B:</b> We can do that, but you'll have to pay a little extra.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I need to order new business cards.<br> <b>B:</b> Do you have any idea how many you'd like?<br> <b>A:</b> I think 2,000 would be enough.<br> <b>B:</b> Would you fill out this form, please?<br> <b>A:</b> I don't want to make any changes to my old card.<br> <b>B:</b> If you detect any difference, I'll take you out to dinner.<br> <b>A:</b> That's it. Here's the form, and here's my old card to use as a model.<br> <b>B:</b> Thank you. Your order will be ready seven days from now.<br> <b>A:</b> I need it sooner. Let me have it in three days, okay?<br> <b>B:</b> We can certainly give you faster turnaround, but it will cost you extra.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I'm about to run out of business cards. I need some new ones.<br> <b>B:</b> We can print as many as you like. Just tell me how many.<br> <b>A:</b> Two thousand should get me through the year.<br> <b>B:</b> Here's a form to get you started.<br> <b>A:</b> My old card is perfect, so all I want you to do is copy it exactly.<br> <b>B:</b> I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card.<br> <b>A:</b> Here you go, your form and my old business card.<br> <b>B:</b> Thanks. Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order, please.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm sorry, but can you give me a three-day turnaround?<br> <b>B:</b> If you don't mind paying a little extra, it's absolutely no problem.<br>
