				<p>  <b>A:</b> I want to try out for the tennis team.<br> <b>B:</b> Our school doesn't have a tennis team.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes it does. They were practicing after school yesterday.<br> <b>B:</b> Were they using a birdie?<br> <b>A:</b> Of course not! That'd be animal abuse!<br> <b>B:</b> A birdie is a plastic, red-nosed tool for badminton.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, I see. Yes, they were using a red tool.<br> <b>B:</b> Then the sport you saw was definitely badminton.<br> <b>A:</b> Is that also why the rackets were so small and thin?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. It's somewhat similar to tennis, though.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, in that case, I want to join the badminton team!<br> <b>B:</b> I wish you the best of luck!  </p>
