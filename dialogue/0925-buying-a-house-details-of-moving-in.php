				<p>  <b>A:</b> This is it. We can move in starting tomorrow.<br> <b>B:</b> No way! Really?<br> <b>A:</b> Yup. We cleared escrow. It's officially ours now.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't know what to say.<br> <b>A:</b> It's time to figure out how we're going to move in.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, I think we should rent a trailer, and move the big stuff first.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, that would make sense.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll start boxing everything else.<br> <b>A:</b> I know of a good moving company. My best friend used them last year.<br> <b>B:</b> Are they affordable?<br> <b>A:</b> I think so. I'll call them tomorrow morning.<br> <b>B:</b> I still can't believe that house is ours. It's a great feeling.  </p>
