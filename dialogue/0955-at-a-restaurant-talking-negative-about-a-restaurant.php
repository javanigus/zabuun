				<h2>Talking Negative about a Restaurant</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I just came back from eating at the new steak place.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, I've been wanting to go there. How was it?<br> <b>A:</b> Don't bother going.<br> <b>B:</b> Really? Why?<br> <b>A:</b> It was terrible. The food was cold, and the service sucked.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, no. I was looking forward to trying it out.<br> <b>A:</b> Like I said, don't bother.<br> <b>B:</b> I mean, how bad was the food?<br> <b>A:</b> It was awful. They got my order wrong, and it was cold.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, maybe it was just an isolated incident.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't think so. I spoke to other diners, and they were disappointed, too.<br> <b>B:</b> I guess that means I have to find another place.  </p>
