				<p>  <b>A:</b> Now that we found our new home, it's time to sell our old one.<br> <b>B:</b> I know. It makes me sad.<br> <b>A:</b> Why is that, Dorothy?<br> <b>B:</b> I don't know. I guess it's because we've lived here so long.<br> <b>A:</b> I know, baby. But it's time to move on.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I know. The kids are all grown up now.<br> <b>A:</b> I'll contact our realtor tomorrow.<br> <b>B:</b> Are you going to use the same one?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I don't think so. I think I'll try someone new.<br> <b>B:</b> Why is that?<br> <b>A:</b> No reason, really. I just want to check around. We're in no hurry.<br> <b>B:</b> That's true. I'm good with that.  </p>
