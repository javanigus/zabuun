				<h2>Recreation Area Problems</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> Could I speak with the manager about some problems in the pool area?<br> 	<b>B:</b> Sure, what seems to be the problem?<br> 	<b>A:</b> My apartment is next to the pool, and there seems to be some really  	late-night partying going on out there.<br> 	<b>B:</b> The hours for the pool are eight in the morning to ten at night. Is the  	noise that you are hearing later than that?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Yes, sometimes people are in the Jacuzzi at midnight!<br> 	<b>B:</b> Did you call the night manager?<br> 	<b>A:</b> No, I didn't really know if anyone was around that late.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am going to give you my number to call if it happens again.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Thank you for your help.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You are welcome. I will be sending letters to tenants to remind them of  	the rules.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I had some concerns about the pool and Jacuzzi area and would like to  	speak with someone.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I can help you with that. What are you having problems with?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I live right next to the pool, and late at night it is really noisy out  	there!<br> 	<b>B:</b> There is not supposed to be anyone in the pool area after ten o'clock at  	night. Are you noticing people out there any later?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I've heard people out there at one in the morning!<br> 	<b>B:</b> Did you contact anyone?<br> 	<b>A:</b> No, I just waited until now to tell you.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will give you the direct line to call to report this when it is  	happening<br> 	<b>A:</b> I appreciate your help.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You are welcome. Evidently a few people need some reminders.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I was wondering if I could speak to someone about some concerns of mine  	with the pool area.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I can answer any questions that you might have. What are your concerns?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I enjoy living next to the pool, but it gets really loud out there at  	night.<br> 	<b>B:</b> The pool is supposed to be closed after 10:00. Are you saying that people  	are partying later than that?<br> 	<b>A:</b> There have been parties out there that haven't ended until two in the  	morning!<br> 	<b>B:</b> Did you call the front desk?<br> 	<b>A:</b> Yes, I tried, but no one picked up.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can have my personal line to call if this happens again. Do not  	hesitate to call.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Thank you for taking care of this for me.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Thank you for bringing it to my attention. We will send reminder memos to  	help people remember what the rules are.<br>
