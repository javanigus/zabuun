				<h1>At a Hotel</h1>
				<h2>Asking about the Swimming Pool</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Is there a swimming pool in this hotel?<br> <b>B:</b> We don't have a full-sized swimming pool, but we do have individual swim  stations.<br> <b>A:</b> What exactly does that mean?<br> <b>B:</b> Basically, a swim station is like a treadmill, except instead of running, you  swim.<br> <b>A:</b> That sounds really neat. Is there an extra charge for these swim stations?<br> <b>B:</b> If you're a registered guest, you have free access to our swim stations.<br> <b>A:</b> Are the swim stations open 24 hours, like the rest of the gym?<br> <b>B:</b> To conserve electricity, the stations operate only from 7:00 a.m. till 10:00  p.m. <br> <b>A:</b> I'll go down there as soon as I can!<br> <b>B:</b> I don't think you'll be disappointed. People really seem to like the swim  stations.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Does this hotel have a pool?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, sir, we don't have one. However, in our gym, we do have swim  stations.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm not sure I understand.<br> <b>B:</b> Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current.<br> <b>A:</b> Cool. What will they think of next? How much are they?<br> <b>B:</b> Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations.<br> <b>A:</b> Excellent! Now what are the hours?<br> <b>B:</b> The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. only.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm going to change into my trunks right now!<br> <b>B:</b> I think you'll like the experience, sir. It's a great workout.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> Do you have a swimming pool in this hotel?<br> <b>B:</b> We don't have a pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in the gym.<br> <b>A:</b> I never heard of a swim station. Is that like a train or bus station?<br> <b>B:</b> It's just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against.<br> <b>A:</b> Holy cow! I never heard of such a thing. How much do they cost?<br> <b>B:</b> As a guest, sir, you pay nothing.<br> <b>A:</b> This sounds better every second. Now, when can I use the stations?<br> <b>B:</b> If you want to swim, you can visit the gym any day between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. <br> <b>A:</b> Oh, boy! This is going to be great. I'm going to the gym right now!<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sure you'll enjoy your workout, sir. Everyone seems to like the swim  stations.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I think I've looked everywhere, but I haven't seen a swimming pool here.<br> <b>B:</b> This hotel has no full-size pool, but we do have swim stations in our gym.<br> <b>A:</b> Swim stations? Whoever heard of such a thing?<br> <b>B:</b> You swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill.<br> <b>A:</b> All that exercise in a little pool! Do I have to pay anything?<br> <b>B:</b> The swim stations are available to all guests for no charge.<br> <b>A:</b> Very good. Now can you tell me the hours of operation?<br> <b>B:</b> They're available anytime between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m., seven days a week.<br> <b>A:</b> Wow! I can't wait to change into my trunks!<br> <b>B:</b> The swim stations are very popular, sir. I hope you don't find a line down  there.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I've been looking for a swimming pool, but I haven't found one yet.<br> <b>B:</b> We have no pool, sir, but we do have swim stations in our gym.<br> <b>A:</b> Swim stations? Could you be a little more explicit?<br> <b>B:</b> You know how you run on a treadmill but don't go anywhere? Well, it's the  same thing.<br> <b>A:</b> Gee, that's a great idea. Now, how much do I have to pay?<br> <b>B:</b> The stations are absolutely free to guests, sir.<br> <b>A:</b> Great! Now, when can I go down there and use the stations?<br> <b>B:</b> The swim stations are open daily from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.<br> <b>A:</b> Boy, oh boy! I can't wait to change into my swim trunks.<br> <b>B:</b> Be warned, sir. At certain hours the swim stations are very crowded.<br>
