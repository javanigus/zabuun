				<h2>A Good Nose</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Some people have good noses.<br> <b>B:</b> I wish I had a good nose. Mine is way too big.<br> <b>A:</b> I don't mean good-looking. I mean good-smelling.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh. But that can be a curse.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, because you can be too sensitive to odors.<br> <b>B:</b> I'll say. My girlfriend has a nose like a drug dog.<br> <b>A:</b> Did she catch you using drugs?<br> <b>B:</b> Sort of. She knows whenever I sneak a cigarette.<br> <b>A:</b> You don't need a good nose for that—cigarettes stink</p>
