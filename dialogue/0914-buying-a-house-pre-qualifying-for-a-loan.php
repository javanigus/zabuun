				<h2>Pre-Qualifying for a Loan</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> The best way to buy a house is to get pre-qualified, Ms. Anderson. <br> <b>B:</b> Why is that, Mr. Williams?<br> <b>A:</b> By pre-qualifying, you know beforehand which house you can buy.<br> <b>B:</b> I thought I would look at houses first.<br> <b>A:</b> That's okay too, but you may be wasting your time.<br> <b>B:</b> How so, Mr. Williams?<br> <b>A:</b> You may find a house you really like, but can't afford it.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, that's when I'll negotiate with the seller.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, that's true, but by pre-qualifying, you'll save time, and effort.<br> <b>B:</b> How is that?<br> <b>A:</b> You will be able to select a home you know you can afford.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay. Then we'll try it your way.  </p>
