				<h2>Asking for Donation</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Would you like to donate money for Christopher?<br> <b>B:</b> Wait, what happened to Christopher?<br> <b>A:</b> He was hit by a car after school the other day.<br> <b>B:</b> What? That was terrible!<br> <b>A:</b> That day I was going to walk home with him, but I decided to go to the library.<br> <b>B:</b> I can't believe it. Is he okay?<br> <b>A:</b> He broke some bones, but other than that, he is okay.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, great! So, why are you collecting money for him?<br> <b>A:</b> The hospital bills are sort of steep. His parents can't afford it.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, wow! Well, here is my last $10. Please send my best to Chris.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you. Every dollar counts.<br> <b>B:</b> Bless your heart for helping him out.  </p>
