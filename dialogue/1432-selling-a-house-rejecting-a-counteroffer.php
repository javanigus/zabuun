				<h2>Rejecting a Counteroffer</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> I was calling to see if the buyers had accepted my counteroffer.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, actually they just called back with a counteroffer of their own.<br> <b>A:</b> Is the counteroffer close to the asking price?<br> <b>B:</b> The counteroffer is for ten thousand less than your asking price.<br> <b>A:</b> I didn't really want to go that low in my pricing.<br> <b>B:</b> I agree that that price is too low. Your home is in good shape, and you  should get a better price for it.<br> <b>A:</b> What should I do at this point?<br> <b>B:</b> Since you don't want to go any lower, we can notify them that you are  rejecting their latest offer.<br> <b>A:</b> Can you take care of that for me and get back to me?<br> <b>B:</b> I will let them know that your counteroffer was the lowest price that you  will accept.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Has there been any word about whether the buyers have accepted my  counteroffer?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I was going to call you this morning. Your buyers have responded with a  counteroffer.<br> <b>A:</b> Is the counteroffer a good one?<br> <b>B:</b> They are now offering ten thousand less than your asking price.<br> <b>A:</b> That is really a bit lower in price than I would like to go.<br> <b>B:</b> I think that your feelings are valid. You have a beautiful home and can  afford to wait for a better offer.<br> <b>A:</b> What is the next step?<br> <b>B:</b> You can flat-out reject their offer and see what they come up with.<br> <b>A:</b> I would like you to notify them that I am rejecting their offer.<br> <b>B:</b> I will notify the buyers that you will not accept their counteroffer.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I was wondering if the buyers have accepted my counteroffer.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I just faxed you the information an hour ago. The buyers have a  counteroffer for you.<br> <b>A:</b> How much did they counteroffer?<br> <b>B:</b> They now are offering to pay ten thousand less than your asking price.<br> <b>A:</b> I am not really ready to accept that low of a price.<br> <b>B:</b> I wouldn't accept that price either. Your home is in a good area and should  command a higher price.<br> <b>A:</b> Where do we go from here?<br> <b>B:</b> We should notify them that you are rejecting their current offer. They might  choose to offer a higher price.<br> <b>A:</b> Please let the buyers know that I am rejecting their offer.<br> <b>B:</b> I will take care of that right away. They may or may not raise their offer.<br>
