				<p>  <b>A:</b> Do you know who won against the Dodgers and the Cubs?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, but I don't follow baseball.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, really? Why not?<br> <b>B:</b> I've never really got into baseball. I like basketball better.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, okay. Do you have a cell phone?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, why do you ask?<br> <b>A:</b> Could you check to see who won the baseball game?<br> <b>B:</b> Sure, let me check. It'll take one minute. It looks like the Chicago Cubs won seven to three.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes! I was rooting for the Cubs.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, they won. Glad I could be of some service.<br> <b>A:</b> Thanks again. Have a nice day.  </p>
