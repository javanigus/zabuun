				<h2>Fighting a Parking Ticket</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> Hey, I got this parking ticket; can you help me figure a way out of it?<br> <b>B:</b> First of all, did you park somewhere too long or in the wrong spot?<br> <b>A:</b> I was there too long.<br> <b>B:</b> Was the area clearly labeled with the time limit and all?<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, I saw it.<br> <b>B:</b> You will need to convince the judge that you couldn't see the signs.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, I understand.<br> <b>B:</b> Whatever you do, you need to be respectful and polite to the judge.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, you're right.<br> <b>B:</b> Just try to talk to him about how IF you made a mistake that it won't happen again.<br> <b>A:</b> OK, I will.<br> <b>B:</b> Good luck!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Man, I got another parking ticket. I am so unlucky--what can I do?<br> <b>B:</b> Was your car where it wasn't supposed to be, or did you stay there too long?<br> <b>A:</b> I was in an area where I wasn't supposed to park.<br> <b>B:</b> Could you tell where you were supposed to park and for how long?<br> <b>A:</b> I could tell what I was supposed to do.<br> <b>B:</b> That's too bad. That means that you can't use receipts or a witness to help  you out. <br> <b>A:</b> I guess not.<br> <b>B:</b> Try brown-nosing the judge, but don't be too obvious about it.<br> <b>A:</b> Sure, if it will help.<br> <b>B:</b> Try and convince him that something was labeled wrong or something.<br> <b>A:</b> Sounds good!<br> <b>B:</b> Give it your best shot; it might work.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I don't know how to fight a parking ticket.<br> <b>B:</b> Did you get written up for exceeding the time limit or for parking where you  weren't supposed to be?<br> <b>A:</b> Both.<br> <b>B:</b> Did you see all the signs and just decide to blow them off?<br> <b>A:</b> I was confused.<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe you could explain that you are new and got confused--could you do that?<br> <b>A:</b> If it might work, I'll go for it!<br> <b>B:</b> Let the judge see that you are only a poor starving student who won't do it  again.<br> <b>A:</b> I can see how that might work.<br> <b>B:</b> Without actually saying that the parking ticket guy was an idiot, make it  seem as though it was HIS mistake, not yours!<br> <b>A:</b> I could do that!<br> <b>B:</b> Try it. It just might save you the price of a parking ticket.<br>
