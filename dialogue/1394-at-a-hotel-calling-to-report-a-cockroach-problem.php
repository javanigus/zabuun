				<h1>At a Hotel</h1>
				<h2>Calling to Report a Cockroach Problem (1)</h2>
				    <b>A:</b> I have a little problem with room 507.<br>   <b>B:</b> What exactly seems to be the problem, Mr. Sandals?<br>   <b>A:</b> I found cockroaches in my room.<br>   <b>B:</b> Cockroaches, sir? That's unbelievable.<br>   <b>A:</b> I've seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room.<br>   <b>B:</b> Sir, are you sure you haven't seen the same silverfish nine times?<br>   <b>A:</b> There are nine cockroaches in my room. I don't have time for your    disbelief!<br>   <b>B:</b> I apologize. One moment, please, while I transfer you to my supervisor.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I'm in 507. I have a few problems with my room.<br>   <b>B:</b> What is that problem, sir?<br>   <b>A:</b> There are cockroaches in my room.<br>   <b>B:</b> Are you sure, sir? Flies I could believe, but cockroaches?<br>   <b>A:</b> I've counted nine different cockroaches, and I accidentally stepped on    another one.<br>   <b>B:</b> Sir, we run a spotless and cockroach-less hotel.<br>   <b>A:</b> You dare to doubt me?<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, sir. Let me transfer you to my supervisor.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> There's a big problem with my room. I'm in 507.<br>   <b>B:</b> Would you tell me the nature of the problem, sir?<br>   <b>A:</b> I have cockroaches crawling in my room.<br>   <b>B:</b> Perhaps you saw a silverfish, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> I've seen nine more cockroaches than I wanted to see.<br>   <b>B:</b> Sir, you haven't been drinking by any chance, have you?<br>   <b>A:</b> How dare you question my statement!<br>   <b>B:</b> Forgive me. You're 100 percent correct. Allow me to transfer you to my    supervisor.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> There's a major problem with room 507.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm sorry to hear that. Please tell me the exact problem.<br>   <b>A:</b> This room is overrun with cockroaches.<br>   <b>B:</b> There has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> I stopped counting at nine.<br>   <b>B:</b> Sir, this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying    colors.<br>   <b>A:</b> Your inspector needs spectacles. The fact is that cockroaches are running    rampant.<br>   <b>B:</b> I apologize, sir. Just a second, while I transfer you to my supervisor.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I'm in 507, and I have a big problem. <br>   <b>B:</b> I'm so sorry. Kindly tell me what the problem is, sir.<br>   <b>A:</b> Everywhere I look, I see cockroaches.<br>   <b>B:</b> Perhaps you could look again, sir, to double-check.<br>   <b>A:</b> The next cockroach I see will be number ten.<br>   <b>B:</b> Mr. Sandals, I've worked here five years without seeing one cockroach.<br>   <b>A:</b> I've already suffered enough without listening anymore to you!<br>   <b>B:</b> You're right, sir. Please let me transfer you to my supervisor.<br>  <hr>          <b>A:</b> I have a little problem with room 507.<br>   <b>B:</b> Problems are what we're here for, sir. Please tell me your problem.<br>   <b>A:</b> This room is filthy with cockroaches. <br>   <b>B:</b> Were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them, sir?<br>   <b>A:</b> I've already seen nine of them and, as they say, eight is enough! <br>   <b>B:</b> Sir, sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots.<br>   <b>A:</b> You are not in a position to question my vision or my statement!<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm very sorry, sir. Will you please hold while I transfer you to my    supervisor?<br>
