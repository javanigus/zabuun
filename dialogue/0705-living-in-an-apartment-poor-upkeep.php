				<h1>Living in an Apartment</h1>
				<h2>Poor Upkeep</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> This floor is falling apart.<br> <b>B:</b> How can you tell?<br> <b>A:</b> Are you kidding me? Step over here.<br> <b>B:</b> You're right. The floor to this apartment is badly damaged.<br> <b>A:</b> See, I told you so.<br> <b>B:</b> What did you do that made the floor like this?<br> <b>A:</b> It wasn't me. It was like this when I moved in here.<br> <b>B:</b> You should report this poor upkeep to the landlord.<br> <b>A:</b> You're right. I'll call him the first thing in the morning.<br> <b>B:</b> Be carful not to damage the floor any further.<br> <b>A:</b> I won't. I hope the landlord replaces the floor soon.<br> <b>B:</b> He probably will.  </p>
