				<h1>At a Hotel</h1>
				<h2>Storing Luggage for a Few Hours</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I'm checking out, but is there a place I can store my luggage for a few hours?<br> <b>B:</b> Why do you need us to hold your luggage, sir?<br> <b>A:</b> My flight doesn't leave for another four hours.<br> <b>B:</b> We can hold your luggage, but there is an additional cost associated with that service.<br> <b>A:</b> How much is it going to cost me?<br> <b>B:</b> It will be $6 an hour.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm going to drink at your hotel bar. Can you hook me up?<br> <b>B:</b> Unfortunately, sir, we cannot. Shall I take your credit card?<br> <b>A:</b> No, forget it. It's cheaper for me to use a locker at the airport.<br> <b>B:</b> Those airport lockers are not always safe though.<br> <b>A:</b> I'll take my chances.<br> <b>B:</b> Good luck with that, sir.  </p>
