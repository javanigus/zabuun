				<h2>Lying on College Applications</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> After seeing your college application, I can tell you're really smart and  talented.<br> <b>B:</b> Not really, I'm lying about almost everything.<br> <b>A:</b> Why?! They're going to find out.<br> <b>B:</b> No, they're not! They're not going to check.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, they will. After a college admits you, they'll ask for your transcript.<br> <b>B:</b> I didn't know that! How about my extracurriculars?<br> <b>A:</b> They'll randomly audit 10% of their applicants.<br> <b>B:</b> What does that mean?<br> <b>A:</b> The UCs will randomly select 10% of their applicants to provide proof of  their extracurriculars. <br> <b>B:</b> It's only 10%.<br> <b>A:</b> It's not that little! You may be chosen. Be careful. <br> <b>B:</b> You're right. It's too risky to lie.  </p>
