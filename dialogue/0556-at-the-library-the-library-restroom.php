				<p>  <b>A:</b> Do you have a restroom?<br> <b>B:</b> Only for employees.<br> <b>A:</b> But I really need to go.<br> <b>B:</b> I can't let you go. There's a restroom in the market across from us  though.<br> <b>A:</b> That restroom is really dirty. It smells like someone died in there.<br> <b>B:</b> Fine, I'll take you to our restroom.<br> <b>A:</b> Yay! Thank you so much.<br> <b>B:</b> We have to go secretly. If anyone sees you use the restroom, I'll be fired.<br> <b>A:</b> Don't worry. I will be small and quiet as a mouse.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, good. The password is 595. Go quickly before anyone sees you.<br> <b>A:</b> Thank you for your kindness.<br> <b>B:</b> You owe me if we ever see each other again.  </p>
