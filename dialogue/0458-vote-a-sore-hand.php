				<h2>A Sore Hand</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> There's something wrong with my right hand.<br> <b>B:</b> What's wrong with it?<br> <b>A:</b> It aches most of the time.<br> <b>B:</b> What do you think it is?<br> <b>A:</b> I don't know. I think it's old age.<br> <b>B:</b> If it's old age, why don't both of your hands hurt?<br> <b>A:</b> That's a good question. Maybe it's not old age.<br> <b>B:</b> Are you right-handed?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes. All my life.<br> <b>B:</b> You're wearing out your right hand. Stop using it so much.<br> <b>A:</b> But I do all my writing with my right hand.<br> <b>B:</b> Start typing instead. That way your left hand will do half the work.  </p>
