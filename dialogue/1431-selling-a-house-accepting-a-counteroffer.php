				<h1>Selling a House</h1>
				<h2>Accepting a Counteroffer</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> My assistant called and said that you had received a response to our  counteroffer.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, the buyers called me just an hour ago.<br> <b>A:</b> Did they accept the counteroffer?<br> <b>B:</b> They came back with their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you  wanted.<br> <b>A:</b> What do you think about their offer?<br> <b>B:</b> I think that this is a good offer. They also would like to have a 90-day  escrow to allow them to sell their home. <br> <b>A:</b> The length of the escrow is not a huge issue with us.<br> <b>B:</b> They also want the sale contingent on a good building inspection.<br> <b>A:</b> That is reasonable, and I accept those conditions.<br> <b>B:</b> I will let them know that you have accepted their counteroffer. They will be  very pleased!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I had a message on my phone that the buyers had responded to our  counteroffer.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, the response just came through on the fax machine.<br> <b>A:</b> Was the counteroffer acceptable to them?<br> <b>B:</b> They made their own counteroffer of five thousand less than you proposed.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you feel that their counteroffer is reasonable?<br> <b>B:</b> Their offer is a good one. They also want to have a short escrow as they have  already sold their home and are ready to move in.<br> <b>A:</b> We can accommodate the buyer's desire for an escrow length of their choosing.<br> <b>B:</b> They want their building inspector to approve the quality of the house.<br> <b>A:</b> I would expect that to be the case and accept their counteroffer.<br> <b>B:</b> I will contact the buyers immediately and let them know of your acceptance of  their counteroffer. I am sure they will be excited!<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I was calling in to see if there had been any response from the buyers  regarding my counteroffer.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, the buyer's agent just contacted me while I was at an Open House.<br> <b>A:</b> Did they state whether the counteroffer worked for them or not?<br> <b>B:</b> They almost accepted your counteroffer price but want to go a little lower.  They are offering five thousand less than your counteroffer.<br> <b>A:</b> In your professional opinion, is this a good offer?<br> <b>B:</b> Personally in today's market, I would accept the offer. They also want a  short escrow as they feel that interest rates are low right now. <br> <b>A:</b> We can either lengthen or shorten the escrow for the buyer.<br> <b>B:</b> They want to make sure that the inspector says that there are no major  problems with the house before this is a solid deal.<br> <b>A:</b> Of course, the house will have to pass a basic inspection, but we accept  their counteroffer.<br> <b>B:</b> The buyers will be happy to hear that you have accepted their counteroffer.<br>
