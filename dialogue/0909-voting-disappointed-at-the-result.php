				<p>  <b>A:</b> I'm really bummed that Di Blasio won the election.<br> <b>B:</b> Really? Why is that?<br> <b>A:</b> I think Republican mayors have been good for our city.<br> <b>B:</b> There's too much inequality.<br> <b>A:</b> You think this new mayor will change that?<br> <b>B:</b> You bet he will. It was his campaign promise.<br> <b>A:</b> Politicians make promises all the time. It doesn't mean anything.<br> <b>B:</b> I think you're wrong.<br> <b>A:</b> Mark my words. This will mean more crime.<br> <b>B:</b> Crime has been going down all over the country.<br> <b>A:</b> Thanks to the Democrats.<br> <b>B:</b> I guess we'll have to give the new mayor a chance.  </p>
