				<h2>A Bad Roommate</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I hate my roommate.<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong with her?<br> <b>A:</b> A lot of things. First of all, she snores so loudly!<br> <b>B:</b> That's not really her fault. What else?<br> <b>A:</b> She never takes a shower.<br> <b>B:</b> That's disgusting! You should tell her to take a shower.<br> <b>A:</b> I did! She got mad at me and then proceeded to slap me.<br> <b>B:</b> Ouch! Did you try to get a new roommate?<br> <b>A:</b> I tried, but I could not. No one was willing to switch.<br> <b>B:</b> I guess you can get a new room by yourself.<br> <b>A:</b> I can't afford it. Ugh, I hate her so much.<br> <b>B:</b> It's okay. The year will be over before you know it.  </p>
