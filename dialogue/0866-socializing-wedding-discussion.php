Maybe your invite was lost in the mail.<br> <b>B:</b> It's okay. Why don't you bring me as your plus one?<br> <b>A:</b> Actually no, because I'm going with my husband.<br> <b>B:</b> Please take pictures so I can see how nice everyone looked.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm sure there will be pictures online afterwards.<br> <b>B:</b> It's not the same as being there.  </p>
