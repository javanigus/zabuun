				<h2>Where to buy a Used Car</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hey, Mark. Do you know where I can look for used cars?<br> <b>B:</b> You could always check online. My friend bought a car from Craigslist.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, I was thinking about that. Do you know any other way?<br> <b>B:</b> There is a dealership that sells used cars on Atlantic Boulevard.<br> <b>A:</b> Where is it? I have never seen one.<br> <b>B:</b> It's on the corner of 7th and Atlantic.<br> <b>A:</b> Oh, by the Burger King?<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah. They have a pretty good selection. You should check it out.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm down. Can you go with me?<br> <b>B:</b> Sure, I am free tomorrow and Thursday. Shoot me a text.<br> <b>A:</b> Will do, man. Thanks.<br> <b>B:</b> Sure thing, bro. You owe me, though.  </p>
