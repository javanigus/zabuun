I'm going to have another talk with them.<br>   <b>A:</b> Anyway, it's been nice knowing you for these past few years.<br>   <b>B:</b> You, too. Keep in touch, and good luck with your new job.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> How's it going, Jim? This is Olivia.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hello, Olivia. What's up?<br>   <b>A:</b> I wanted to let you know that I have to move out.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm sorry to hear that.

Then I'm going to evict    them.<br>   <b>A:</b> Thanks for all your help over the past few years.<br>   <b>B:</b> Thanks. Good luck with your new neighbors and your new job.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hi, Jim. It's Olivia.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hey, Olivia. What's happening?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'll be moving out in a while, so I wanted you to know.<br>   <b>B:</b> Well, that's not good news. When are you moving?<br>   <b>A:</b> The last day of June.<br>   <b>B:</b> Is something wrong with your apartment?<br>   <b>A:</b> No, not anything new. But I just found out that I've been hired for a new    job.<br>   <b>B:</b> Great! What is the new job?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'm going to be an ESL instructor at Pasadena City College.<br>   <b>B:</b> That's great! ESL is some kind of electronics class?<br>   <b>A:</b> ESL is a class for students who are learning English as their second    language.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm glad that your neighbors aren't the reason that you're moving.<br>   <b>A:</b> I won't miss having to listen to their darn TV.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm giving them one more warning about their TV. Then they're out of there.<br>   <b>A:</b> I appreciate what a good apartment manager you've been these past few    years.<br>   <b>B:</b> It's been nice knowing you, too. Good luck teaching LES.<br>    <hr>          <b>A:</b> Hello, Jim. It's Olivia.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hi, there. What can I do for you today?<br>   <b>A:</b> You should know that I'll be moving out in a while.<br>   <b>B:</b> Gee, that's too bad. What day do you plan to leave?<br>   <b>A:</b> June 30 is my last day.<br>   <b>B:</b> I hope it's not your neighbors or the latest rent increase.<br>   <b>A:</b> No, neither one. I got lucky. I found a new job.<br>   <b>B:</b> Hey, give me five! Good for you! What is it?<br>   <b>A:</b> I'll be teaching ESL at Pasadena City College.<br>   <b>B:</b> Great! Is ESL a class about the Internet?<br>   <b>A:</b> No. ESL is English for students whose native language is not English.<br>   <b>B:</b> I was worried that you were moving because of your neighbors.<br>   <b>A:</b> Whoever my next neighbor is cannot possibly be as loud as those people.<br>   <b>B:</b> I'm going to give them 30 days' notice if they don't turn that TV down.<br>   <b>A:</b> Thanks for everything. I'll give you the keys on the thirtieth.<br>   <b>B:</b> You've been a very good tenant. Good luck with your new SLE job.<br>
