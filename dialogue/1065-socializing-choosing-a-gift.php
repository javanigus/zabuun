				<h2>Choosing a Gift</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday.<br> <b>B:</b> Me, neither! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, that would be good!<br> <b>B:</b> We need to think about what she might like. What are her interests?<br> <b>A:</b> If I remember right, she likes music, skiing, and reading.<br> <b>B:</b> You know, maybe we could get her some concert tickets. Who would know her  favorite groups?<br> <b>A:</b> Her roommate, Malia, might know what her favorite groups are.<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah, Malia would be able to help us choose a concert.<br> <b>A:</b> Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now.<br> <b>B:</b> Good! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift.<br>  <hr>        <b>A:</b> I can't figure out what to get Mary for her birthday.<br> <b>B:</b> I am having a problem figuring that out myself. Do you want to pick something  out together?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, that way we would have more money to spend.<br> <b>B:</b> She has a lot of interests. What things do you think she likes to do the  best?<br> <b>A:</b> Well, she really likes going hiking, listening to music, and travel.<br> <b>B:</b> The music idea sounds good. I wonder who knows what concerts she might like  to go to?<br> <b>A:</b> Maybe we could ask her roommate, Malia, who her favorite groups are.<br> <b>B:</b> Malia would be a great help. She has known Mary a long time.<br> <b>A:</b> Let's e-mail Malia and ask her for her suggestions.<br> <b>B:</b> I think that maybe Malia might like to contribute to this gift too.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I have been trying hard to pick out a cool gift for Mary for  her birthday.<br> <b>B:</b> That's been challenging for me too. Would you like to go in with me and  choose something together?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, two heads are better than one.<br> <b>B:</b> What does she like to do? That might help us pick something out.<br> <b>A:</b> She seems to really enjoy music, getting pedicures, and going to the movies.<br> <b>B:</b> Maybe we could get her some concert tickets. Do you know who might know what  concert she might like to go to?<br> <b>A:</b> I think that her roommate, Malia, could give us some suggestions.<br> <b>B:</b> Malia definitely could help us. She knows Mary very well.<br> <b>A:</b> I am going to see Malia this afternoon after class and ask her what she  thinks.<br> <b>B:</b> That will work out well. Perhaps Malia would like to help buy this gift.<br>
