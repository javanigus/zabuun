				<h1>Buying a House</h1>
				<h2>Making an Offer through a Realtor</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> I would like to make an offer on this house, but I don't know much about  	the process.<br> 	<b>B:</b> As your realtor, I am here to take care of this process. How much were  	you planning on offering?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three  	hundred and fifty thousand dollars.<br> 	<b>B:</b> We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room. Let's offer three  	hundred and twenty thousand dollars.<br> 	<b>A:</b> That sounds good, but I don't want this house to get away from me.<br> 	<b>B:</b> The market is fairly down right now, so the offer is a realistic one.<br> 	<b>A:</b> When will we know if they accept the offer?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime?<br> 	<b>B:</b> You are already pre-qualified for your loan, so you are in good shape.<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> I have never bought a house before and don't know how to make an offer.<br> 	<b>B:</b> The process of actually making the offer is something that I will take  	care of for you. What price were you considering offering?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I love this house and would be willing to pay the full asking price of  	three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Let's leave some room on this offer. I think that three hundred and  	twenty thousand dollars is a fair offer in this housing market.<br> 	<b>A:</b> We could try that, but I really want this house!<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is common practice to offer and then have a counter-offer.<br> 	<b>A:</b> How long will it take to find out if they are going to accept the offer?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The sellers are usually fairly quick to respond. They want to get things  	moving.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Should I tell my bank that I have made an offer?<br> 	<b>B:</b> There really isn't anything else to do right now except wait. You are  	already pre-qualified for your loan.<br>  <hr>         	<b>A:</b> I have never done this before and don't know where to begin as far as  	making an offer on this house.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Leave the details of making the offer up to me. What were you thinking  	you should offer?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I absolutely must have this house and will pay three hundred and fifty  	thousand dollars or more.<br> 	<b>B:</b> It is best to start a little low on the first bid to allow for a  	counter-offer. How about offering three hundred and twenty thousand dollars?<br> 	<b>A:</b> I hope that the owners aren't insulted by that offer.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Your offering price is not out-of-line. The owners will either take it or  	make a counter-offer.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Does it usually take very long for the owners to get back to you with an  	acceptance?<br> 	<b>B:</b> It usually doesn't take very long for owners to respond to an offer. <br> 	<b>A:</b> Should I be in touch with my bank to tell them to get the loan papers  	ready?<br> 	<b>B:</b> The only thing you should do now is relax. You already are pre-qualified  	for your loan.<br>
