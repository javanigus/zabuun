It was a gift from my husband.<br> <b>A:</b> He has excellent taste.<br> <b>B:</b> It's because he knows exactly what I like.<br> <b>A:</b> I wish my husband had your husband's taste in fashion.<br> <b>B:</b> Doesn't he know what you like?<br> <b>A:</b> Hardly. He bought me an ugly sweater for Christmas.<br> <b>B:</b> Did you return it?<br> <b>A:</b> No, I entered it in the gift exchange at work.<br> <b>B:</b> What did you get in return?<br> <b>A:</b> A department store gift card.<br> <b>B:</b> Just make sure you use it for shopping, and not for your husband!  </p>
