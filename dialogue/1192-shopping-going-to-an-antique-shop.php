				<h2>Going to an Antique Shop</h2>
				   <b>A:</b> I want to find an old music box.<br> <b>B:</b> We have a great selection. What decade are you looking for?<br> <b>A:</b> Do you have anything made in the 1920s?<br> <b>B:</b> We have six.<br> <b>A:</b> Do any of them have dancing figures?<br> <b>B:</b> Actually, two of them have dancing figures.<br> <b>A:</b> That's fantastic. I think I like this one.<br> <b>B:</b> A good choice. I prefer that one myself.<br> <b>A:</b> Is there any warranty with this?<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, no, I'm afraid not. These things are just too old to guarantee anything.<br> <b>A:</b> I understand.<br> <b>B:</b> Even if they break down, they're still works of art.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Excuse me. I'm looking for an old music box.<br> <b>B:</b> Any particular decade?<br> <b>A:</b> Something made in the 20s would be nice.<br> <b>B:</b> We had seven, but we sold one this morning.<br> <b>A:</b> Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes?<br> <b>B:</b> You're in luck. Two of them have dancing figures.<br> <b>A:</b> These are great. I think I'll take this one.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, that one is very nice.<br> <b>A:</b> Does this come with a warranty?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, but you just have to take your chances.<br> <b>A:</b> That doesn't surprise me.<br> <b>B:</b> Even if it doesn't work, it's a beautiful collectible.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> Pardon me. I need an old music box.<br> <b>B:</b> Exactly how old a box do you want?<br> <b>A:</b> Actually, I was thinking about something from the 1920s.<br> <b>B:</b> We still have six left.<br> <b>A:</b> Do any of the boxes have dancing figures?<br> <b>B:</b> Dancing figures are quite popular. Two of the boxes have them.<br> <b>A:</b> I love the dancing figures. I'll take this music box.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, I think you'll be very satisfied with that one.<br> <b>A:</b> I was wondering, does this come with any kind of warranty?<br> <b>B:</b> No. But if something goes wrong with it, I know someone who repairs these things.<br> <b>A:</b> I was just hoping.<br> <b>B:</b> It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I want to purchase an old music box.<br> <b>B:</b> We have a good variety. What decade would you like?<br> <b>A:</b> I was hoping I could find something made in the 20s.<br> <b>B:</b> There are six on this table.<br> <b>A:</b> I hope at least one of them has dancing figures.<br> <b>B:</b> Many people like the dancing figures. Two of our boxes have the figures.<br> <b>A:</b> It's so hard to choose. I think I'll take this one.<br> <b>B:</b> That one will bring you many hours of pleasure.<br> <b>A:</b> Does a warranty come with this music box?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, but if it breaks down, you're on your own.<br> <b>A:</b> I just thought I would ask.<br> <b>B:</b> When you buy a Model T, you can't expect a warranty.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I'm searching for an old music box.<br> <b>B:</b> You came to the right place. Any particular decade?<br> <b>A:</b> If you had a box made in the 20s, that would be nice.<br> <b>B:</b> We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six.<br> <b>A:</b> Would any of them have dancing figures?<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures.<br> <b>A:</b> They're both so beautiful. Let me have this one, I think.<br> <b>B:</b> That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it?<br> <b>A:</b> One last question: Do you provide a warranty with the box?<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, no. Everything we sell here is â€˜as is.
