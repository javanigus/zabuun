				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hey, Richard, I could sure use your help.<br> <b>B:</b> What is it, Jerry?<br> <b>A:</b> I can't seem to land an interview.<br> <b>B:</b> Have you applied to many places?<br> <b>A:</b> Yes I have. I've sent out about 50 resumes.<br> <b>B:</b> Did you include cover letters?<br> <b>A:</b> On some I did, others, no.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, that may be your problem. You should always include a cover letter.<br> <b>A:</b> Really? Why?<br> <b>B:</b> It shows you took the time to research the company. HR people like that.<br> <b>A:</b> Okay, I will. Thanks.<br> <b>B:</b> You're welcome. I think you will see more interest in your resume now.  </p>
