				<p>  <b>A:</b> Wow! Our order is sure taking long.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, it is. It's been nearly 45 minutes now.<br> <b>A:</b> Well, maybe they're just very busy.<br> <b>B:</b> I don't know, dear. I was watching our waiter.<br> <b>A:</b> What did you see?<br> <b>B:</b> He actually handed in orders for two tables before us.<br> <b>A:</b> You mean after he took our order.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. He was goofing off. I could see him from here.<br> <b>A:</b> How do you know he did this.<br> <b>B:</b> Like I said, I was watching. He forgot our order.<br> <b>A:</b> That's terrible.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, well he's not going to get a good tip from me.  </p>
