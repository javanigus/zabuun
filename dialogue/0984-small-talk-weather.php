				  <b>A:</b> It's an ugly day today.<br> <b>B:</b> I know. I think it may rain.<br> <b>A:</b> It's the middle of summer, it shouldn't rain today.<br> <b>B:</b> That would be weird.<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah, especially since it's ninety degrees outside.<br> <b>B:</b> I know, it would be horrible if it rained and it was hot outside.<br> <b>A:</b> Yes, it would be. <br> <b>B:</b> I really wish it wasn't so hot every day. <br> <b>A:</b> Me too. I can't wait until winter.<br> <b>B:</b> I like winter too, but sometimes it gets too cold.<br> <b>A:</b> I'd rather be cold than hot.<br> <b>B:</b> Me too.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> It doesn't look very nice outside today.<br> <b>B:</b> You're right. I think it's going to rain later.<br> <b>A:</b> In the middle of the summer, it shouldn't be raining.<br> <b>B:</b> That wouldn't seem right.<br> <b>A:</b> Considering that it's over ninety degrees outside, that would be weird.<br> <b>B:</b> Exactly, it wouldn't be nice if it started raining. It's too hot.<br> <b>A:</b> I know, you're absolutely right.<br> <b>B:</b> I wish it would cool off one day.<br> <b>A:</b> That's how I feel, I want winter to come soon.<br> <b>B:</b> I enjoy the winter, but it gets really cold sometimes.<br> <b>A:</b> I know what you mean, but I'd rather be cold than hot.<br> <b>B:</b> That's exactly how I feel.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> I wish it was a nicer day today.<br> <b>B:</b> That is true. I hope it doesn't rain.<br> <b>A:</b> It wouldn't rain in the middle of the summer.<br> <b>B:</b> It wouldn't seem right if it started raining right now.<br> <b>A:</b> It would be weird if it started raining in ninety degree weather.<br> <b>B:</b> Any rain right now would be pointless.<br> <b>A:</b> That's right, it really would be.<br> <b>B:</b> I want it to cool down some.<br> <b>A:</b> I know what you mean, I can't wait until it's winter.<br> <b>B:</b> Winter is great. I wish it didn't get so cold sometimes though.<br> <b>A:</b> I would rather deal with the winter than the summer.<br> <b>B:</b> I feel the same way.<br>
