				<h2>A Recommendation Letter (1)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hey Professor Lopez, I need a favor.<br> <b>B:</b> What kind of favor?<br> <b>A:</b> Can you write a recommendation letter for me?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm sorry, but I can't.<br> <b>A:</b> Why not? I was a good student.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, you were. The thing is, I don't know you that well.<br> <b>A:</b> I'll just give you my resume, and you can write about how great I am!<br> <b>B:</b> I can't. I don't think I can write you a good letter.<br> <b>A:</b> But I don't know who else to ask.<br> <b>B:</b> Ask someone who knows you as more than just a student.<br> <b>A:</b> I honestly never had a professor I felt close to.<br> <b>B:</b> Then, you can only hope a professor writes a letter for you regardless of  that fact.  </p>
