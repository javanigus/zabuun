				<h1>Renting an Apartment</h1>
				<h2>Poor Upkeep</h2>
				              <b>A:</b> I would like to make an appointment to discuss the problems I keep having  	with my apartment.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Are you having problems? This is the first I've heard of it.<br> 	<b>A:</b> We gave you a list of problems last week.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What kind of problems are you talking about?<br> 	<b>A:</b> The garbage disposal doesn't work, we have rats, and the toilet is  	backed up.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Maybe I could get back to you in a few weeks. I am leaving on vacation  	this afternoon.<br> 	<b>A:</b> These things are your responsibility, and you need to fix them  	immediately.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Don't tell me what to do! I'll get to it when I get around to it!<br> 	<b>A:</b> If these problems are not addressed immediately, I will be contacting the  	health department this Friday.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I'll be right over!<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> We would like you to stop by again so we can show you some more problems  	that have come up with our apartment.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am kind of busy right now, but maybe later next week I could stop by.<br> 	<b>A:</b> We sent you an e-mail the first week we moved in; it listed the problems  	we found.<br> 	<b>B:</b> What problems did you find?<br> 	<b>A:</b> The roof leaks when it rains, there is mold on the bedroom walls, and the  	dishwasher doesn't work.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I don't really consider any of that to be my responsibility. You can fix  	those things yourself.<br> 	<b>A:</b> Maintaining basic health and safety standards is your responsibility.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I am maintaining the building. You are way too picky!<br> 	<b>A:</b> Unfortunately, you won't be getting a rent check unless these problems  	are fixed by Friday.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You wouldn't dare do that!<br>  <hr>        	<b>A:</b> You really need to look at some of the problems we are having with the  	apartment.<br> 	<b>B:</b> That apartment never had any problems before. Are you sure the problem  	isn't you?<br> 	<b>A:</b> We spoke with you the first week we moved in about things that you  	promised to fix.<br> 	<b>B:</b> Where do you think you have problems?<br> 	<b>A:</b> There is no hot water, the bedroom has a broken window, and there are  	rats in the kitchen.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You know, no one else who has been in that apartment has had a problem  	before.<br> 	<b>A:</b> You are obligated to maintain your building and my apartment.<br> 	<b>B:</b> I will fix these problems when I get around to it.<br> 	<b>A:</b> I will be withholding my rent check this Friday unless these problems are  	addressed immediately.<br> 	<b>B:</b> You can't do that! It's illegal!<br>
