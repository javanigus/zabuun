				<h2>Requesting a Wake-up Call</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I have an early meeting, so can I get a wake-up call?<br> <b>B:</b> Sure! What time should we call you?<br> <b>A:</b> Can you call my room at six in the morning?<br> <b>B:</b> Just tell me your room number.<br> <b>A:</b> I'm staying in room 302.<br> <b>B:</b> Okay, Mr. Roberts. We'll call you at 6 a.m.<br> <b>A:</b> What happens if I don't answer?<br> <b>B:</b> Then you'll probably miss your meeting.<br> <b>A:</b> Can I request a second wake-up call?<br> <b>B:</b> What time should we schedule the second wake-up call?<br> <b>A:</b> Call me again at 6:15 a.m. if I don't answer at six.<br> <b>B:</b> So we have one wake-up call at six and a second one fifteen minutes later.  </p>
