				<h2>A Recommendation Letter (2)</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> My professor wrote a really bad recommendation letter for me.<br> <b>B:</b> You read his recommendation letter?<br> <b>A:</b> Yeah. I couldn't resist.<br> <b>B:</b> This is why you shouldn't read it. You might not like what you see.<br> <b>A:</b> He wrote such boring things about me. <br> <b>B:</b> What did he write?<br> <b>A:</b> Just that I'm a diligent student who does well.<br> <b>B:</b> At least it was nothing bad. You can always ask another professor.<br> <b>A:</b> I know, but I don't have time.<br> <b>B:</b> When do you need another recommendation letter by?<br> <b>A:</b> I need one by this Friday.<br> <b>B:</b> Oh, wow! Maybe you should just send the one you have now.  </p>
