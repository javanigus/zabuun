				<p>  <b>A:</b> Hi! Sorry I took so long to meet you.<br> <b>B:</b> That's alright, we have plenty of time.<br> <b>A:</b> Who is that girl sleeping on your shoulder?<br> <b>B:</b> She's just someone else riding the bus.<br> <b>A:</b> You mean you don't know her?<br> <b>B:</b> No. She boarded after I did and fell asleep.<br> <b>A:</b> Don't you mind her leaning on your shoulder?<br> <b>B:</b> No, I don't. She must be exhausted.<br> <b>A:</b> What if she misses her stop?<br> <b>B:</b> I heard her say she's going to Main Street.<br> <b>A:</b> Hey, that's our stop, too!<br> <b>B:</b> Yeah, so just let her sleep. It'll be fine.  </p>
