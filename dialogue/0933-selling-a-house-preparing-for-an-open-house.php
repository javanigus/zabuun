				<p>  <b>A:</b> Good morning, Alice. Today's the big day!<br> <b>B:</b> Yes, it is. Are we ready for this?<br> <b>A:</b> I think so. You know I've been working on the house.<br> <b>B:</b> I know, Richard. I guess I'm just nervous.<br> <b>A:</b> I wouldn't worry, babe. We've worked very hard on this.<br> <b>B:</b> Yes. I know, but still ...<br> <b>A:</b> We cleaned the house, spruced up the yard, and painted the interior.<br> <b>B:</b> I know, Richard. I'm worried about the things we didn't do.<br> <b>A:</b> I think we'll be okay. If something comes up, we'll deal with it then.<br> <b>B:</b> You think of everything.<br> <b>A:</b> No. I don't, Alice. We think of everything.<br> <b>B:</b> You're right. We'll be ready.  </p>
