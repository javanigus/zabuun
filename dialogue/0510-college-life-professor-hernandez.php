				<h2>Professor Hernandez</h2>
				<p>  <b>A:</b> I hate Professor Hernandez!<br> <b>B:</b> Me too! He keeps calling me stupid!<br> <b>A:</b> You think that's bad? He gave me an F, because I double spaced my essay!<br> <b>B:</b> But every professor wants essays double spaced. He's crazy!<br> <b>A:</b> Professor Hernandez is weird. He wants essays triple spaced.<br> <b>B:</b> That's just a waste of paper. Why does he like triple spacing?<br> <b>A:</b> He says it's because he has to make a lot of corrections, because we're  stupid.<br> <b>B:</b> We should start a petition, and get him fired!<br> <b>A:</b> We should, but he can find out.<br> <b>B:</b> I know. If he found out, he would ruin everyone's life.<br> <b>A:</b> He is so evil.<br> <b>B:</b> That's why this petition has to work!  </p>
