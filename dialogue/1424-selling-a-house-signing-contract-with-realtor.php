				<h2>Signing Contract With Realtor</h2>
				  <b>A:</b> My wife thinks I should get a lawyer to look at the contract.<br> <b>B:</b> Well, it certainly wouldn't hurt to have a lawyer review it.<br> <b>A:</b> How much does a lawyer cost?<br> <b>B:</b> I don't know. A good real estate lawyer might cost $400 an hour.<br> <b>A:</b> That can't be legal! <br> <b>B:</b> Just think how much it'll be 10 years from now.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you know any lawyers that are cheaper than that?<br> <b>B:</b> You'd have to check the yellow pages or go online.<br> <b>A:</b> There's no telling how many hours the lawyer will charge me for.<br> <b>B:</b> Also, it might take a week or two just to get an appointment.<br> <b>A:</b> I'd rather get this over with, so just show me where to sign.<br> <b>B:</b> Good man! I've marked all the places for you to sign and date.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> My wife said to have a lawyer look at the contract.<br> <b>B:</b> That's always a good idea.<br> <b>A:</b> Do you know how much a lawyer runs?<br> <b>B:</b> I've heard that they're about $400 an hour.<br> <b>A:</b> Who can afford that?<br> <b>B:</b> A few years ago, $100 an hour was outrageous.<br> <b>A:</b> Can you help me find a cheaper lawyer?<br> <b>B:</b> I'm afraid I can't help you with that.<br> <b>A:</b> The lawyer will start at $400, but where will it end?<br> <b>B:</b> Also, a good lawyer might not have time to see you immediately.<br> <b>A:</b> My wife's going to kill me, but just show me where to sign.<br> <b>B:</b> Now you're talking. The red stickers indicate where to sign and date.<br>  <hr>         <b>A:</b> My wife told me to get a lawyer to review the contract first.<br> <b>B:</b> A smart husband always does what his wife tells him.<br> <b>A:</b> How much are lawyers charging nowadays?<br> <b>B:</b> It's hard to believe, but I think they charge about $400 an hour.<br> <b>A:</b> That's highway robbery!<br> <b>B:</b> I think lawyers are making twice what doctors are making.<br> <b>A:</b> Are there any lawyers that are cheaper than that?<br> <b>B:</b> The best advice I can give you is to Google it.<br> <b>A:</b> I can barely afford one hour, but certainly not two.<br> <b>B:</b> Remember, it might take a few days just to set up an appointment.<br> <b>A:</b> I really don't have the time or the money, so where do I sign?<br> <b>B:</b> Your wife will thank you. Just sign and date where the little red stickers are.<br>
