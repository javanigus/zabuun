				<h1>Police Arrest Fire-Starters</h1>
				<p> At a televised news conference, County Sheriff Lee Baca announced the arrests. However, at least one homeowner was still bitter. "That's good detective work, but so what?" asked Martha Knapp. "These arrests aren't going to rebuild our homes or diminish our misery. These guys are young—half of their income for the rest of their lives should go toward paying for our losses. But that will never happen. I wish they had all been in my home when it burnt down. I would have enjoyed kicking their dead bodies."</p>
