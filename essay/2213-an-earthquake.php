				<h1>An Earthquake</h1>
				<p>The children didn't have school due to the earthquake, so they spent the day with their parents. Jacquelyn was so proud of her parents, because they knew what to do during this disaster. She talked to her friends, and they weren't so lucky. Jacquelyn went up to her mother and father and hugged them, because she knew she felt the protection of her parents.</p>
