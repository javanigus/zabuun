				<h1>It's the Thought that Counts</h1>
				<p> When Adam and Constance got around to opening their gifts a few days later, Constance opened an envelope from her uncle Chandler. In it was $100 cash. But, the cash was inside a Jewish card for Happy Hanukkah! The note in the card was, "I couldn't find a wedding card that I liked. I know this is Jewish, but it really is a beautiful card, don't you think? Love, and Best Wishes." Constance did not send her uncle a thank you note, nor did she ever talk to him again. She was unable to think about her wedding again without thinking about that card. </p>
