				<h1>Time to Shop</h1>
				<p>  It was time to go to the market. He had no bananas, no apples, and no milk. He got into his car and drove to the market. It was only five minutes away. The parking lot was almost empty. Good, he thought. He wouldn't have to stand in a long line. He parked his car and walked over to the shopping cart area. He pulled out one of the carts and pushed it ahead of him into the store. Inside, he grabbed an alcohol wipe and wiped the handle of the cart. Then he grabbed another wipe and wiped his own hands. You can never be too careful, he thought. He turned left and walked over to the produce section. Today was his lucky day. Apples were on sale, a dollar a pound. Usually they were two dollars a pound or more. He put 10 apples into a plastic bag and weighed the bag. It was three pounds. He walked over to the bananas. They were the regular price, 79 cents a pound. He bought three pounds of bananas. When he saw the carrots, he remembered that he needed carrots, too. He put a two-pound bag of carrots into his cart. They were only $1.29. He walked to the dairy section and saw that a gallon of milk was $4. He put one into his cart and walked back to the front of the store. He paid for his food, got his receipt, and walked out to his car. He put the food into his trunk and drove home.  </p>
