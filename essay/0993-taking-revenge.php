				<h1>Taking Revenge</h1>
				<p> Hannah unlocked the door with a paperclip and went inside the house. She saw her belongings near the fireplace. She grabbed the belongings and put them inside a big, black bag. She also stole some money, although it wasn't a lot. She realized that there wasn't anything worth stealing, so she spray painted the walls.</p>
