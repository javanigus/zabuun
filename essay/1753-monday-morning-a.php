				<p>Mike had known this, but he needed to know where the iron was at. "Where is the iron, Maria?" he quickly asked. "It's in the closet," she answered. "No, it's not," he replied. Maria then remembered where the location of the iron was. "Check under the bed," she said and turned to her side. Mike poked his head under their bed and found what he was looking for. He hurried and ironed his clothes for work. After, he went to the kitchen and had a small bowl of cereal. Maria entered the kitchen and sat down with Mike.</p>
