His first foray into the entertainment industry came while a college student at Ball State University, where he served as a radio broadcaster for the student-run station. He moved to Los Angeles in 1975 at the behest of his former wife. Once in L.A., Letterman began doing stand-up comedy, at the world famous Comedy Club, and his career was launched.</p>
