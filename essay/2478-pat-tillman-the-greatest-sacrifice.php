				<h1>Pat Tillman: The Greatest Sacrifice</h1>
				<p>Following the September 11 attacks, Tillman turned down a $3.6 million contract with the Cardinals to enlist into the Army to help combat terrorism. Along with his brother Kevin, who turned down a career in professional baseball, the two men completed basic training, and were sent overseas. Tillman served several successful tours of duty in both Iraq, and Afghanistan before he was killed on April 22, 2004. The details surrounding his death became a controversy in the months after he was reported killed in action. Originally, the army listed his death as combat related. It wasn't until approximately one month after his death that the army changed the cause of death to friendly fire. Tillman's family claimed the army used Tillman to advance its image during a dark time in U.S. history. His death by friendly fire, which means he was killed by U.S. military personnel, not the enemy, caused a backlash against the army.</p>
