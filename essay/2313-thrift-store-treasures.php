				<h1>Thrift Store Treasures</h1>
				<p>The painting the old lady had pointed at was of a cat collage with almost 20 different cat faces jumbled atop of one another.  "Definitely not my first choice," thought Mary. However, she trusted destiny's decision and bought the painting for five dollars. After putting it up online, she began receiving dozens of emails asking if the picture frame displayed came with the painting. In order to see what all the buzz about the frame was about, she took it to an antique store and asked if there was anything special about the frame. "Of course, it is special!" remarked the clerk at the store. "Its wood and age make it at least $25,000!" Mary ended up selling the frame for $30,000. A few days later, the buyer returned the ugly painting to her through the mail.</p>
