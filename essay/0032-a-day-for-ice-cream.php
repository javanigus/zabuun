				<h1>A Day for Ice Cream</h1>
				<p>  It is a sunny day. She feels hot. She fans herself with a book. It is still hot. She turns on the air conditioner. It is still hot. She jumps into a pool. It is still hot. Her dad has an idea! He takes her to the ice cream shop. They share a banana split. She does not feel hot anymore.  </p>
