				<h1><b> 7. Shopping for a Dress </b></h1>
				<p>  Janice wanted to buy a dress for a dance party. She wanted to shop with her mom. Her mom is a writer for a fashion magazine. She has good taste, but she did not have time to shop with her daughter. She sent her husband to shop for a dress with her. Janice loved her dad, but she did not like shopping with him. He always got tired from walking. He always got bored from looking at clothes. He never likes what Janice likes. He always thinks her dresses are too short and revealing. Janice thinks her dad is too traditional. Shopping with her dad was worse than shopping alone.  </p>
