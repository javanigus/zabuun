				<h1>Parental Punishment</h1>
				<p>  Parents have different ways of punishing their kids. Some parents ground their kids. Grounding means that kids are not allowed to do fun things. This includes watching TV, going out with friends, and playing video games. Some parents give their kids long speeches. They would yell at them or tell them what they did wrong. Some parents give their kids the silent treatment. The silent treatment is when the parents don't talk to the kids. Some parents make their kids do more chores. Some parents don't even punish their kids! They are very lenient.   </p>
