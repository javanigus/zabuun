				<h1>Dodgers vs. Giants</h1>
				<p>The Dodgers were playing the Giants that night. The two teams have been playing each other for about 100 years, ever since both teams were in New York. The Giants moved the same year the Dodgers did. only they moved up north to San Francisco. That didn't stop the rivalry though. The teams hate each other today as much as they did back in New York. The best part of the night was that the Dodgers won, so I had a couple of Dodger Dogs. "I don't know what they do to these hot dogs, but they are delicious," I told Josie. She wiped some mustard off her face and said, "Absolutely!"</p>
