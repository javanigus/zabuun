				<h1>No More Searching</h1>
				<p>  He walked into the drugstore. Where are the eyedrops, he wondered. He looked at the drugstore signs. Signs were hanging above each aisle. He read sign after sign. He finally saw the eyedrops sign. He walked to the eyedrops section. He looked on the top shelf. He looked on the middle shelf. He looked on the bottom shelf. Where were the eyedrops? Was he in the right section? He looked at the sign again. Yes, he was. He finally found the eyedrops. He went to the front of the drugstore. He stood in line to pay. Someday, he thought, shopping will be faster. Someday, he thought, I will walk into this store. I will ask out loud, "Where's the Crest toothpaste?" A bright light will appear above my head. I will follow the light directly to the Crest toothpaste section. The light will disappear. My searching days will be over.  </p>
