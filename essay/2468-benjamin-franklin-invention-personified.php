				<h1>Benjamin Franklin: Invention Personified</h1>
				<p>Franklin was a tireless separatist, and fought the English for colonial independence with dogged tenacity. He made at least two diplomatic trips to the British Isles to petition for colonial independence. Upon his return from the second trip, the revolutionary war with England had already begun. He was one of the original signers of the historic Declaration of Independence.</p>
