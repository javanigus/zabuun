				<h1>Looking for Singers</h1>
				<p> Andrew made posters. They read, "Looking for great singers". He handed them out around town. Many people showed up to audition. A lot of them sounded very good. Andrew's favorite was a beautiful girl. "She sounds terrible!" said all his band mates. "You guys are crazy," Andrew replied. He thought she was perfect. "Love is making you deaf!" said Andrew's brother.  </p>
