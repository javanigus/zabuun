				<h1><b> 17. Dine and Dash </b></h1>
				<p>  Chris is a waiter. He greets customers. He serves people food. He takes down people's orders. He collects the checks. He cleans the cafe. Sometimes people "dine and dash." This means that people do not pay for the food they ate. Chris was warned that people sometimes try this. He was told that he should try to prevent it. One day, Chris saw two customers run out. Chris ran after them. "Hey! Come back here!" Chris said. "What did we do wrong?" they asked. "You two did not pay!" Chris yelled. "Yes, we did. We were just racing to see who is faster," one of them said. Chris blushed. He felt bad. He went back to the cafe. The money was not there. They had lied to him.  </p>
