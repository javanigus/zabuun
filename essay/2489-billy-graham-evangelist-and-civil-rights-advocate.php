				<h1>Billy Graham: Evangelist and Civil Rights Advocate</h1>
				<p>One of Graham's most powerful tools was his crusades. He began staging evangelical events at arenas and auditoriums to spread the word of god. He was one of the first preachers to invite black clergymen to participate in his crusades. He was also a champion of integration. In one famous incident, Graham went into the audience to remove barriers that were set up to segregate blacks from whites. He told the organizers that they either remove the barriers, or they can stage their event without him. Graham was a man of high moral character.</p>
