				<h1>A time for Family</h1>
				<p>We dropped everyone off and I decided to go with my dad to pick up my brother. When we arrived at the house, my brother was sitting on the couch watching television with the children that lived there and drinking hot chocolate. My dad hugged him and said sorry. The people who lived there said that it was fine that their children liked my brother because he was funny. They said he could come back anytime. I was relieved nothing had happened to my brother.</p>
