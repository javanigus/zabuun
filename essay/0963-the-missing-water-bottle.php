				<h1>The Missing Water Bottle</h1>
				<p> Jared goes to Lucas. "Do you have my water bottle?" Jared asks. "I gave it to Richard to give to you," Lucas says. That was weird since Richard was the first person he asked about the water bottle. Jared went back to Richard. "Lucas said you had my water bottle," Jared said. "I told you, I saw Albert hold it. Lucas probably meant Richard Lopez, not me," Richard said. "I'm just going to buy a new water bottle," Jared said. He bought a blue one this time.</p>
