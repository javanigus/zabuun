				<h1>Paying Your Fare</h1>
				<p>Light rails, subways, and trains usually have a similar system of paying your fare. However, people cannot pay to ride using cash since there is no one there to collect the fare. Most rail-based mass transit systems require a token or a fare card. Many rail systems have turnstiles that are locked until you swipe or tap your fare card.  Some people do not like fare cards because they worry about where they are going being tracked.</p>
