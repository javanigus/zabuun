				<h1>A new Addition to the Family</h1>
				<p>After eight and a half months had passed, Betty gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. My family and I were as happy as it could be. They named the baby Mark. Mark was the name of my father, who passed away a year ago. My brother said that he looked like my dad, so he decided to give him the name in honor of my dad. We all gathered at the hospital and started laughing, talking. We each took turns carrying the baby. It was the happiest moment in our family's history. We only wished that my father would have been a part of it. Jeff looked at baby Mark. He told me that my father's spirit was here. He would always be there to look over and take care of Mark. I smiled and gave him a hug.</p>
