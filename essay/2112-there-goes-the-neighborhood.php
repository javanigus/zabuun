				<h1>There Goes the Neighborhood!</h1>
				<p> "It's going to be a nightmare," said one neighbor. "We're already talking to some realtors. Three years of construction. Three years of trucks going back and forth every day. And then parties every weekend? We can't even sue him—I think he's got more money than our whole state. No, it's time to move. We went from having the nicest neighborhood to having the worst neighborhood, all because of one new neighbor. I wonder who the idiot is who told him about our street." </p>
