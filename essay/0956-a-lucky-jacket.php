				<h1>A Lucky Jacket</h1>
				<p> When Anna entered the interview room, she started to sweat. She wondered why it was so hot. She realized that the heater was on. She sat down across from the interviewer. "Anna, you're sweating. You should take your sweater off." Anna laughed nervously. "I'm fine," she said. By the end of the interview, there was a sweat stain on Anna's sweater. She left the interview feeling unsure. A week later Anna got a phone call from the boss. The boss offered her the job! The lucky jacket worked!</p>
