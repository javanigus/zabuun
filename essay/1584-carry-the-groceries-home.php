				<h1>Carry the Groceries Home (2)</h1>
				<p>  Two weeks later, Brian bought a sturdy wooden stick. He took it into Gristedes. He bought his groceries. The checker put them in four double plastic bags. He took the stick and the four heavy bags outside. He put the bags on the sidewalk. He put two on the left and two on the right. He slid the stick through the plastic handles. He stood between the bags. He lifted the stick to his chest. He grunted. He lifted it over his head. He grunted. He rested the stick on his shoulders and the back of his neck. Two bags were hanging from each side of the stick. He started walking. He was comfortable. What a genius, he thought. He stopped after a block. His shoulders were aching. By the time he got home, his shoulders, neck, and back were aching. He needed to invent a better invention.  </p>
