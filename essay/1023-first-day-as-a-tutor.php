				<h1>First Day as a Tutor</h1>
				<p> Megan started to get upset and blamed Bethany for teaching her incorrectly. Bethany was insulted. She had been speaking and writing in Italian since she was four years old. "Megan, why don't you take a short break and come back to this?" Bethany suggested. Hopefully that would calm her down. "Why don't you take a long break and get out of here?" Megan said. Bethany left her house, she didn't need to take insults from a teenager.</p>
