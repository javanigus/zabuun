				<h1>A Loyal Friend</h1>
				<p>  Belinda and Casey are friends. Belinda and Sandy are enemies. They all go to the same school. They are all 10th graders. Belinda talks to Casey about Sandy a lot. She always says a lot of bad things. One day, Casey and Sandy bump into each other. They both fall down. They both drop all of their belongings on the floor. Casey spilled coffee on her shirt. "Ah man! This shirt is new!" she said. Sandy apologized. She offered to buy her the same shirt. Casey said it was okay. Sandy smiled. She introduced herself. Casey walked away. Belinda wouldn't want them to talk.   </p>
