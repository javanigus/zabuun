				<h1>The Carnival</h1>
				<p>"Please, mom, please. I'm big enough now," I would scream. However, she kept saying, "You're too young, Billy. Maybe one day." Of course, 7-year-old kids have short memories. I kept asking over and over again until she finally said okay, but she said she was going with me. "I'm a big boy, mom. I can go alone," I said. She would not agree. "We're going together, or not at all," she said. And of course I said okay</p>
