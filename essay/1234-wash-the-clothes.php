				<h1>Wash the Clothes</h1>
				<p>  Pat looked at the washer. The washer had dials on it. It had two dials on it. There were words next to each dial. Each dial had three words next to it. The words next to one dial were Small, Medium, and Large. This dial was for the size of the load. Did Pat have a small load, a medium load, or a large load? The words next to the other dial were Cold, Warm, and Hot. Did Pat want to wash her clothes in cold water, warm water, or hot water? Pat turned one dial to Large, and the other dial to Hot. Then she pushed the Start button on the washer.  </p>
