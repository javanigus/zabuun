				<h1>The Lonely Girl</h1>
				<p>  She is lonely. She does everything alone. She watches TV by herself. She does not even like watching TV with her family. She even eats alone at restaurants. She is on her school's basketball team. She does not talk to the other players. She just plays the game.  </p>
