				<h1>After the Death of a Music Collector</h1>
				<p>During his time in the music industry, my father had collected various objects. He had different items from different artists. He had one of Jimi Hendrix's guitars, and a medallion that Janis Joplin had given him. Did I know this? No, I didn't. My dad always kept to himself. He was out on the road a lot, and he never really cared about keeping in touch with his kids. So, when he died, I figured all of his stuff at the cabin would be garbage. I told the town's Sheriff to throw everything out. I also told him to send me the paperwork for the cabin. I read about the discovery they made in my father's cabin. I couldn't believe it! Hendrix's guitar sold for over a million dollars, and so did the medallion. As I had already asked the Shariff to throw out everything as garbage, I wasn't entitled to anything, which probably made my father happy.</p>
