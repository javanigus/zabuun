				<h1>Parades and Horses</h1>
				<p> Renee was very generous with her time and her horses. But owning horses wasn't cheap. You had to rent the stables, and there were always veterinarian and feed bills. Renee knew how to cope with expenses, though. Her vet always gave her a 10-percent discount for paying cash. She always bought the no-name, generic feed for the horses. Her vet had told her it was just as healthful and tasty as the brand name stuff. She always bought economy gasoline. And on parade days, Renee always packed her own lunch and ate with her horses. </p>
