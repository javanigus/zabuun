				<h1><b> 42. She Wants to Get Twins </b></h1>
				<p>  Amy was ready to have kids. She always wanted two. She was scared to give birth. It seemed painful. She really wants twins. She thinks that it is better for her to get it over with at one time. She does not want to go back to the hospital. She also thinks twins are cute. She can dress them up similarly. They can have matching names. Amy is thinking of naming one of them Macy and the other one Tracy. If they are boys, she will name them Todd and Rod. The chances of her getting twins is not that high. It is more likely to be pregnant with one baby.  </p>
