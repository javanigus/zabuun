				<h1>Writing a Story</h1>
				<p>  Thomas had to write a story for class. His English teacher wanted him to write a story about anything. He had no idea what to write. He could not think of a good idea. He wanted to do well on this assignment. This was an important assignment. It would count a lot towards his grade. After a while he decided to go outside. He took a walk in the park. The park gave him some inspiration. He decided to write a story about a family who was having a picnic in the park. His story would have a twist. He would make the family get superpowers from being in the park. He ran home. He was excited to write his story.   </p>
