				<h1>Too Cute</h1>
				<p> After a week, Mia didn't hear from the interviewer. She decided to call. She asked if she got hired. The interviewer said she was not. Mia asked why. The interviewer said it was because her co-workers wouldn't take her seriously. He also said that the company needed to have employees who looked mature. Mia was upset that her appearance was such a big disadvantage to her.</p>
