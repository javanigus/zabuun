				<h1>The Toilet Tank (2)</h1>
				<p> Three hours later, Stanley noticed a puddle of water, hardly bigger than a quarter, on the bathroom floor. He called Henry, who said the plastic nut just needed a little tightening. But because he was working all that day on another job, he wouldn't be able to come over until tomorrow. He told Stanley to put a big plastic bowl under the tank and not to worry. "It's just a tiny leak. Your bathroom won't get flooded." </p>
