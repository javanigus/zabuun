				<h1>Getting Braces</h1>
				<p> The orthodontist looked at his teeth. He took several pictures and x-rays. He told Paul that he would start to put the braces on. Paul was scared. However, it did not hurt as much as he thought. After the orthodontist was done, Paul was relieved. He felt weird to have metal things on his teeth though. He had trouble eating. His parents bought him ice cream.</p>
