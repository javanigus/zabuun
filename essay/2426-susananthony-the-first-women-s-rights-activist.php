				<h1>Susan B. Anthony: The First Women's Rights Activist</h1>
				<p>In 1872, after touring the country trying to build momentum for women's rights, she illegally voted in the presidential election. She was arrested and fined, even though she fought. Anthony never paid the fine. The incident served to bring more awareness to the struggle women had to endure. Anthony fought the good fight until her death in 1905 at the age of 84. She is honored today by the United States mint with the Susan B. Anthony $1 coin.</p>
