				<h1>Baseball Tryouts</h1>
				<p>The coach went out to talk to Robert: "Sorry, son. This sport is not for everyone." Robert didn't understand. He felt angry and sad. He thanked the coach for the opportunity, and started walking off the field. Then he heard some of the guys making fun of him for being small. Robert couldn't take it anymore. He started running home. The coach saw Robert start running and couldn't believe how fast he was running. Robert was running faster than the team's fastest player. The coach told his assistant, "Go to the office and get me the home number for that kid." Robert got home, and his dad told him the good news. He had gotten on the team. Robert couldn't believe it. He heard the coach's message, "Sorry, for not believing in you, Speedy. Welcome to the team."</p>
