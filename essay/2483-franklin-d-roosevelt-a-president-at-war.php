				<h1>Franklin D. Roosevelt: A President at War</h1>
				<p>Roosevelt served as president until his death in 1945. He had suffered from illnesses during his lifetime, and succumbed to a cerebral hemorrhage during a stay at a hospital. His legacy is firmly in place as the man who took a country with more than 13,000,000 unemployed. By the time he left office, less the 2 percent of the workforce was unemployed. He will always be known as the great leader that guided the country through its darkest hours in history.</p>
