				<h1>Shopping Addiction</h1>
				<p>  Michelle just discovered online shopping. She loved how convenient it was. She never had to leave her computer. She never had to get up. All she had to do was type and click. Technology is great! She decided to buy a textbook for school. Then, she looked for a cell phone case. She bought one with a striped design. She then went on a clothing website. She bought $100 worth of clothes. Her sister entered her room. She noticed how much Michelle was buying. Her sister pulled her out of the room. Michelle was banned from online shopping.   </p>
