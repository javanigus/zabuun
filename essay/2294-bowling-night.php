				<h1>Bowling Night</h1>
				<p>Before long, the two friends were bowling away in their new team and league. The manager was right. Paul and Jennifer were among the best players. They both loved bowling in a league. They got to wear team bowling shirts and hats, and all the refreshments were included in the league fees. Soon they were knocking down pins.
