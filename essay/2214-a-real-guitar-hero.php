				<h1>A Real Guitar Hero</h1>
				<p>When Max turned 17, he joined a band. They played local shows and were able to record some songs by themselves. One day as Max was walking home from band practice, someone stopped him and took away his guitar. He was devastated. He went home and locked himself in his room. He couldn't face his dad. He knew he had let him down. When it was time for dinner, Max opened his bedroom door and saw his dad's Fender Stratocaster on the guitar stand. There was a letter and a set of keys on the guitar. The letter said "To my guitar hero, Max. Here is my guitar, you need it more than I do, and the key to your new car, so nothing like this will happen to you again."</p>
