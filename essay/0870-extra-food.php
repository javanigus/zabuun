				<h1>Extra Food</h1>
				<p> At the end of the dinner, there were a lot of leftovers. "Anyone want to take food home?" the soccer coach asked. The players shook their head. They didn't like leftovers. "I'm just going to throw everything away then," the coach said. "No! That is such a waste. This could feed a family," said one of the players. The other members agreed. The coach had an idea. He drove to the homeless shelter. "Hi! I would like to donate all this food."</p>
