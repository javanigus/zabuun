				<h1>Pimple at Prom</h1>
				<p>  Pamela always gets pimples at the worst time. She once had a pimple during her birthday party. She once had a pimple when she had to make a speech. She once had a pimple on her first date. Pamela expected that she would get a pimple on prom. Prom is a special dance for high school students. Girls wear pretty dresses and heels. Guys wear fancy suits and ties. Pamela wanted everything to go perfectly. She made sure she would not get any pimples. She ate healthily. She drank a lot of water. She used lotion constantly. She used pimple cream, too. On prom day, she looked at the mirror. Her face was clear. It was the first time she had clear skin on a special day.   </p>
