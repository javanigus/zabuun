				<h1>The Unlikely Reunion</h1>
				<p>Finally one day, a cab driver who heard Wati's story happened to know an old man with that name in a nearby town and decided to take her to him. Although the old man did not recognize her at first, he took Wati to see his daughter. "When I saw my mother, I knew it was her," said the 15-year-old. "I just knew." The parents were able to confirm that it really was their daughter based on a scar and birthmark on the girl's hip. This miraculous story is unfortunately one of the only confirmed reunions among families that were separated by the disaster.</p>
