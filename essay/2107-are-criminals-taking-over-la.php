				<h1>Are Criminals Taking Over LA?</h1>
				<p> "This city's getting ridiculous," said a local neighborhood watch member. "Criminals are killing people almost every day. They laugh at us. They know that, even if convicted, they will get free housing, free meals, and free medical care. And they get to sit around in jail all day reading magazines! That's punishment? It sounds more like a reward! What do the rest of us get for being HONEST? We get to work hard all day so we can die tired and poor."  </p>
