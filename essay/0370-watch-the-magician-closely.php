				<h1>Watch the Magician Closely</h1>
				<p>  A magician is cool. He makes things disappear. He makes them reappear. He changes things into other things. He changes a bunny into a scarf. He changes a scarf into a bird. He gives you a deck of cards. You secretly pick a card. He knows which card! He knows so many cool tricks.  </p>
