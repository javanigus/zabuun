				<h1>The Demolition Derby</h1>
				<p>Demolition derbies got their start in New York in 1947 when former stock car racer Larry Mendelsohn realized that many people liked watching crashes more than racing. He began staging his derbies and they soon became popular at fairs and festivals. There are few rules involved with driving in a derby. Drivers can use any part of their cars to ram into other vehicles to disable them. The only rule is drivers cannot hit the driver side door where the driver sits. Most competitors use the rear portion of their vehicles to ram others, so as not to disable their own motors. Demolition derbies are a true American creation.</p>
