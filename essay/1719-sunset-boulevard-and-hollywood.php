				<h1>Sunset Boulevard and Hollywood</h1>
				<p>Just north of Sunset Blvd lies Hollywood Blvd, which is a major tourist attraction. One of the greatest features of Hollywood Blvd is the Walk of Fame, which distinguishes Hollywood Blvd from any other street in the country. It features memorial plaques embedded into the cement on the sidewalk. The plagues are stars with names of famous movie actors and actresses, from the past to the present. It is considered a great honor to have a star on streets of Hollywood.</p>
