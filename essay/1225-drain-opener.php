The water did not go down the drain. The water stayed in the sink. What was the matter? Why didn't the water go down the drain? Mike waited and waited. The water didn't go anywhere. It sat in the sink. Mike opened a bottle of liquid Drain Opener. He poured the Drain Opener into the sink. Mike waited one minute. Then all the water went down the drain.  </p>
