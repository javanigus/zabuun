				<h1>A Step Pet</h1>
				<p>James had an idea. Just like he shared custody of Robert with his ex-wife, what if he shared custody of the dog Spot. James could bring the dog to the house when he picked up James every Thursday and bring the dog back to his ex-wife's house on Sunday. Linda thought it was an interesting idea and agreed to try it. James's ex-wife Patricia really liked the idea. It gave her a break from having to take care of Spot. Robert was really happy because he didn't have to leave his dog behind, and his best animal friend could be with him all the time. Linda's daughters were especially happy to have a part-time pet. "Now we have a step brother and a step pet!" they said.</p>
