				<h1>Soccer Tryouts</h1>
				<p> The coach set up a game for the boys to play. Howard was on the "red" team. Someone passed the ball to Howard. Howard stopped in the middle of the field. "What are you doing, man?" his teammate asked. Howard took a deep breath and told himself he could do it. Howard got his head back into the game. He caught the ball with his foot and made a goal. He couldn't believe it; no one could. Howard made the team.</p>
