				<h1>Grandpa Died</h1>
				<p>  Edith called her husband Archie. "Daddy's dead. I was holding his hand when he died. Our son's wedding is tomorrow. What are we going to do?" she asked. "I just left the nursing home. Should we tell Earl or not? He loved Daddy so much." Archie said, "Well, your dad has been very sick. Earl knows that. So his death won't be a surprise. But the news will make everyone sad. Tomorrow should be a happy day for everyone. Maybe we should just say nothing. We can tell everyone later. No one needs to know right now. I'll talk to the funeral director. We can have the funeral next week." "But Earl will be on his honeymoon," Edith said. "He'll be gone for two weeks. He'll be hurt and angry if he misses Daddy's funeral." Archie said, "You're right. This is a difficult decision. What are we going to do?"  </p>
