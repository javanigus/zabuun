				<h1>Murals Are Over 200 Years Old</h1>
				<p> All 23 murals, created about 1791, are now at the Museum of Native American Art. They will be inspected, cleaned, archived, and examined by experts. They will not be put on public display until early next year. Museum officials expect a huge turnout when that day occurs. "This is truly rare," said one official. "I wonder how many more treasures are out there waiting for someone to drop a dime on them." </p>
