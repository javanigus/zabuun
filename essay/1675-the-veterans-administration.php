				<h1>The Veterans Administration</h1>
				<p>Since that time, the VA has expanded greatly, and now provides additional services such as educational benefits, and home-buying assistance. It also helps those veterans who had become homeless after their service to their country ended. There are approximately 30 million military veterans living in the U.S. today. That number represents nearly 10 percent of the population of the country today.</p>
