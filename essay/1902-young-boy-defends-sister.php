				<h1>Young Boy Defends Sister</h1>
				<p> All hospitals in the area were alerted to watch for Woody, because Curt said that he "got him good." In fact, said one doctor, Woody should get to a hospital as soon as possible. He might bleed to death if Curt actually punctured one of Woody's kidneys. The paramedics and police commended little Curt for his bravery. He said that it was his responsibility to protect his sister, because "when Daddy's not home, I'm the man of the family."  </p>
