				<h1>The Gulf Disaster</h1>
				<p>  She said the gulf disaster wasn't a big problem. "How can you say that?" he asked. "Millions of gallons of oil are pouring into the ocean." She said it was a big ocean. The oil spill was a drop in the bucket. "Besides, oil and water are natural," she said, "so they can get along with each other." He agreed that oil and water are natural. He said that people are natural, too. Does that mean that oil and people can get along with each other? Would she drink an ounce of oil? Would she swim in oily water? "Of course not," she said. He said that fish were swimming in oily water. Seabirds were eating those fish. "But they're animals," she said. "They adapt to these things." He said dead fish were lying on beaches. Dead birds were lying on beaches. "That's not adapting," he said. "That's dying."  </p>
