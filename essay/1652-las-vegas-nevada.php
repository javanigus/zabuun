				<h1>Las Vegas, Nevada</h1>
				<p>Las Vegas is now a gambling town, where people from all over the United States come to vacation. Its population is under 2,000,000, making it the 30th largest city in the country. Its original population in 1905 was only 5,000. Much of the city's growth is due to the gambling industry. Many states have since legalized gambling, including New Jersey, and California, but Las Vegas remains the No. 1 tourist city for gamblers in the U.S. Today some of its largest and most beautiful hotels include Bellagio, Flamingo, Caesars Palace, Treasure Island, Mandalay Bay, and Wynn. These hotels are on Las Vegas Boulevard, which is commonly called "The Strip." With its nearly year-round sunshine, beautiful casinos, and variety of gaming options, Las Vegas remains the best location for gambling in the U.S.</p>
