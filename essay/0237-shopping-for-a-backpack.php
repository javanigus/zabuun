				<h1>Shopping for a Backpack</h1>
				<p>  Samantha was starting her first day of 6th grade in two weeks. She needed a new backpack. Her backpack from last year was ripped. This year she wanted a cool backpack to start off her middle school years. She did not know where to begin. She went to the mall and began searching. Her mom suggested she get something with flowers. Her dad suggested she get something plain. However, when she saw this backpack, she knew it was meant to be hers. The backpack had several pockets to hold all her belongings. It was also made of sturdy and durable material. The backpack was pink with purple dots. She immediately grabbed it and asked her mom if she could get it. Her mom said okay and handed her some money. She was very excited.   </p>
