				<h1><b> 30. Pencil Sharpeners </b></h1>
				<p>  Nancy was coloring her drawing in her art class. Her green-colored pencil broke. She took out her pencil sharpener. It was brand-new. Her mom got it for a good price. She put the pencil in the hole. She twisted her pencil a few times and took it out. The tip was already falling off. She put the pencil in the hole again. She twisted her pencil again. The tip was still not sharp. The sharpener was bad. Her art teacher told her to use her pencil sharpener. It was electric. She put her pencil inside the hole. She did not have to twist it herself. She just had to hold it. The pencil was perfectly sharpened.  </p>
