				<h1>McBurgers Recalls Glasses</h1>
				<p>  Twelve million glasses is a lot of glasses. McBurgers is recalling 12 million glasses. The glasses promote the new Shrek movie. The glasses have pictures of the different Shrek characters. They are pretty pictures. But the pictures contain a chemical. The chemical is dangerous. It can make people sick. To make sure that it gets all the glasses back, McBurgers is offering a "Double Your Money Back program. Every customer will receive twice the original price per glass. "That's great," said Diane. She had bought five glasses. But she was going to wait. Eventually there would be only a few glasses unreturned. She would wait until the recall was almost over. Her glasses would be the last five glasses that were unreturned. They would have more value. She would demand 100 times the price she had paid for them. "If McBurgers doesn't pay, I'll call the TV news," Diane said.  </p>
