				<h1>Plane in the Hudson</h1>
				<p>  The passenger plane landed a year ago. It was a famous landing. It was on TV and the radio. It was in the papers. The plane landed in the Hudson River in January. The pilot had no choice. Both engines were damaged. He couldn't go back to the airport. He couldn't land in New York City. He had to land in the river. The plane landed gently. It was a soft landing. The plane didn't flip over. It landed on its belly. No one died. Everyone survived. Everyone got out of the plane. They stood on the wings of the plane. Everyone was cold and wet. Boats rescued them all. It was the "Miracle on the Hudson." Today the same passengers got on two boats. The two boats went to where the plane had landed. They stopped on that spot in the Hudson. Everyone hugged one another. Life was good.  </p>
