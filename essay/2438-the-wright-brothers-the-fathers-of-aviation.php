				<h1>The Wright Brothers: The Fathers of Aviation</h1>
				<p>The brothers were very protective of their new invention, and made it difficult for reporters to chronicle their efforts. This led to widespread rumors that the entire thing was a hoax. For the next several years, the brothers worked to refine their flying machine in secret, leading to more doubt. However, in 1908, the brothers took their invention to Le Mans, France to put on an exhibition. Wilbur guided his aircraft making turns and other maneuvers, which amazed the crowd. Soon, the Wright Brothers were famous. They changed the way people travel.</p>
