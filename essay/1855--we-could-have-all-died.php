				<h1>"We Could Have All Died!"</h1>
				<p> A new prime minister had just taken over in England. He said that God was watching over London.  Scotland Yard believed that terrorists were behind the bombing attempts. When one patron at the nightclub found out how close he had been to death, he said, "I'm so happy to be alive! Last night I was dancing all night near the windows next to the street, and I would have been one of the first to die. It's scary to think about. I won't be coming to this club for another week or so." </p>
