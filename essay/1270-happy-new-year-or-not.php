				<h1>Happy New Year, or Not?</h1>
				<p>  It was New Year's Day. He lived in Las Vegas. He drove over to a casino. He walked over to a roulette table. He bought one chip for $100. He flipped a coin. He caught the coin. It was heads. He put the $100 chip on red. The dealer spun the roulette wheel. The wheel went round and round. The dealer pushed the silver ball. The ball went round and round. The wheel slowed down. The ball slowed down. The ball dropped into a red slot. He won! The dealer gave him a $100 chip. He gave the dealer a $10 tip. He cashed in both his chips. He went home. He felt good. It was going to be a good year.  </p>
