				<h1>The World Trade Center</h1>
				<p>The World Trade Center survived a bombing in 1993. The skyline and spirit of New York City were changed after September 11, 2001. That morning, two planes crashed into the World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan. At first the top floors of the buildings were in flames. Soon they came tumbling down, covering lower Manhattan in hot metal and ash. A total of 2,753 people died. For weeks the air smelled of burnt metal and plastic. It took eight months for the site to be cleaned. Years later, The World Trade Center is rebuilding. There is a new tower, called the Freedom Tower. There is also a memorial and museum to honor those who died in the 2001 attack.</p>
