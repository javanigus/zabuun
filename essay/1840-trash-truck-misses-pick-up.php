				<h1>Trash Truck Misses Pick-up</h1>
				<p> Felix left a message on Susan's answer machine, saying to forget it. Then he went downstairs and pulled the almost full container back into its space in the carport. Let it sit there till next Tuesday, he told himself. Had he left another message, he was worried that his building would accidentally get dropped permanently off Acme's pick-up list. </p>
