				<h1>George S. Patton: World War II Hero</h1>
				<p>Patton was involved in the most significant campaigns the country fought in the great war. His defining moment may have been his command of American forces during the infamous Battle of the Bulge. This battle was Adolf Hitler's last ditch attempt to turn the fortunes of war toward the Germans after a series of defeats at the hands of the Allied forces. It was an epic tank battle won by the United States that sealed his legacy as a field commander.</p>
