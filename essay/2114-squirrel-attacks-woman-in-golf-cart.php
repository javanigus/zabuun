				<h1>Squirrel Attacks Woman in Golf Cart</h1>
				<p> John Dean, an attorney for the golf course, said the golf course was not responsible for the actions of its animals. He added, "If the ladies want to sue, they'll have to sue the squirrel. We're still assessing the damage to the cart and the green. It looks fairly light; I doubt that the driver will owe us more than $1,000."  </p>
