				<h1>Albert Einstein: Intelligence Personified</h1>
				<p>It was Einstein who first conceived of a nuclear fission weapon that he felt Germany was on the verge of discovery. He urged President Franklin D. Roosevelt to begin development of a similar weapon, but also felt it was best not to use it. His warning about the Nazis served the president well, and the Manhattan Project was born. This project was designed to develop a nuclear weapon in the United States in case Hitler unleashed his own weapon. Einstein was a life-long pacifist. He spoke of the purity of science, and how it should be used for the betterment of Humankind, and not for creating weapons of mass destruction. Because of his high IQ, Einstein's name has become synonymous with intelligence in the United States.</p>
