				<p>  The swim team needs to make some money for uniforms. The swim captain decided to have a car wash. Cars will drive through the parking lot. The swim team members will wash the car. It takes about 15 minutes to clean the cars. It costs seven dollars to get a regular-sized car washed. It costs ten dollars to get a van, truck, or SUV washed. The swim team did not end up making much money. The swim captain was upset. He felt like it was his fault. Car wash fundraisers usually do not do well. People do not trust teenagers with their cars.  </p>
