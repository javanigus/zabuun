				<h1>Flat Tire (A)</h1>
				<p>Mike did not agree that cats were the better pet. But he chose not to argue with Maria. He did not want to ruin her happy mood. Mike asked her if they should go buy some cat food. Maria said they should. Mike turned around and drove towards the direction of the super market. After five minutes of driving the car made a loud popping sound. Mike and Maria were surprised when they realized that one of their tires had popped. Mike parked his car on the side of the road, and got out to see the damage.</p>
