				<h1>Earthquake</h1>
				<p> One night, Jim was fast asleep. Suddenly, his bed started shaking. He jumped out of bed. Jim was terrified. This was his first earthquake. Jim had no idea what to do. He froze while everything around him was falling and breaking. The earthquake lasted 15 seconds. To Jim it felt more like an hour. The next morning, Jim started packing his bags. "I've had enough of California!" he said.  </p>
