				<h1>The Speed Limit</h1>
				<p>  The speed limit around residential areas is usually 25 miles per hour. People usually go above this. Except Sara. Sara was driving to work. She turned on the radio. Her favorite song came on. She started nodding her head. Then, she heard a honk. It came from behind. A driver wanted to pass her. She was driving at 25 miles per hour. He shouldn't be honking. She was following the rules. She started driving slower. He was getting mad. He kept honking. She drove even slower. She was now driving 10 miles per hour. He switched to the right lane. Then, he drove passing her.   </p>
