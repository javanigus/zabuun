				<h1>Josh's First Girlfriend</h1>
				<p>What happened next was something he could not believe. It turned out Diana went around the block too, but Josh didn't know that then. He accidentally ran into her one day and they started to talk. One thing led to another, and soon Josh was looking forward to going home the long way. They started walking together and Josh discovered Diana was just as shy as he was! They walked and talked every day and began liking each other. Soon they began telling everyone that they were boyfriend and girlfriend. This just shows how something good could come from something bad!</p>
