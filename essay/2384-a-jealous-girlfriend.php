				<h1>A Jealous Girlfriend</h1>
				<p>One day, Carol had a fight with her best friend. When it was all over, she went to talk to Kevin at his house, but he wasn't home. It turned out that Kevin had always liked Carol's best friend. He kept it secret, but once he found out that they had started fighting, he realized that it was his chance. Kevin eventually got in a relationship with Carol's best friend; Carol eventually got over Kevin. "Jealousy is not a good look on a person," Kevin said. He told me that he did what he did because of how jealous Carol was.</p>
