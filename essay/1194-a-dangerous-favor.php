				<h1><b> 45. A Dangerous Favor </b></h1>
				<p>  Tyler invited Jeremy to the mall. Jeremy was surprised. Tyler was the cool guy at school. What did Tyler want with him? They agreed to meet outside the video game store. "Hey Tyler, what's up?" Jeremy asked. "So you want to be cool?" Tyler asked. "Of course I do," Jeremy said. "Steal that video game for me," Tyler said. Jeremy gasped. He knew that stealing was bad. He did not want to do it. "But that's illegal!" Jeremy said. "Don't think of it as stealing. Just think of it as doing a favor for me," Tyler said. It was a favor that would get Jeremy in big trouble.  </p>
