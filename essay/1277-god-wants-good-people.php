				<h1>God Wants Good People</h1>
				<p>  God takes good people to heaven. He wants good people to be with Him. He leaves bad people on Earth. He doesn't want bad people near Him. He lets them do bad things on Earth. When they die, He sends them to the devil. The devil makes them work every day. They work next to a big fire. They are always right next to the fire. They are always hot from the fire. They carry coal. The devil makes them carry heavy buckets of black coal. They carry the coal to the fire. They pour the coal on the big fire. Then they refill the big buckets with more coal. They never get a drink of water. They never get to rest.  </p>
