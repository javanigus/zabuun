				<h1>Please Don't Hurt Me!</h1>
				<p> The family of the murdered girl is upset. Her dad said, "He'll probably die of old age in his sleep. My daughter has been dead for 30 years. But her killer is still alive. He eats three hot meals a day. He gets free medical care. He gets free dental care. He hurt my daughter, but the state cannot hurt him. My family and I suffer, while he enjoys life. It's not fair." </p>
