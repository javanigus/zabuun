				<h1>The Best Donut on Earth</h1>
				<p> Dough Nutty was an hour away from Ginny's house. Her brother made fun of her for driving so far just to eat donuts. When Ginny and Rebecca got there, the store was closed! The girls felt so frustrated. They decided to get donuts at the gas station nearby. It was not the best, but it was still pretty good.</p>
