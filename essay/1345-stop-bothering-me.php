				<p>  He gave her a hug. She pulled away. "Stop bothering me," she said. "I'm not 'bothering' you," he said. "I'm giving you a hug. I'm showing affection." "You're bothering me," she said. "I'm trying to make dinner. You're in the way. Do you want me to drop something? Do you want me to burn something? Do you see how busy I am? I'm chopping green onions; you hug me. Do you want me to cut myself? I'm stirring the noodles; you hug me. Do you want me to knock the pot off the stove? I'm making dinner for us. This is how I show affection. You give me a little hug. That's not affection. That's bothering me. Do you really want to show affection?" He said yes, he really wanted to show affection. "Wait until after dinner," she said. "Then you can really show affection. You can wash the dishes!"  </p>
