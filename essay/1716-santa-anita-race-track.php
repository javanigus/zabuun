				<h1>Santa Anita Race Track</h1>
				<p>There are various ways to bet on a horse at Santa Anita, or at any racetrack. The most common is to bet a horse to win a race. Bettors can also bet on a horse to come in second, which is called to place, or to come in third, called show. Additionally, bettors can place a bet for a horse to win, place, or show, which means a person is betting a horse that will come in at least third. There are other methods for betting, including the Daily Double, where a bettor tries to pick the winner of two horse races that are established by the track. Pick Six is another popular betting venue. In this bet, a bettor picks the winner of six races, which is very difficult, but the payout is substantial.</p>
