				<h1>It's Just Business</h1>
				<p> May went back out to her car and waited. Mr. Wang was whistling as he returned to the car. He apologized for making her wait. She said it was no problem. Then she drove Mr. Wang back to his hotel. He thanked her for her help, and said he was returning to China the next day. She didn't say anything about what she had overheard. She went home and tried not to cry about what had just happened—she must be strong.</p>
