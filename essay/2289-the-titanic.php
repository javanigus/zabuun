				<h1>The Titanic</h1>
				<p>Most of those killed that night were men. The protocol followed by the ship's officers required "women and children first," when loading lifeboats. The accident was met by international shock and grief. Many of today's maritime rules were put into place because of this disaster. Only 705 passengers floating on lifeboats were saved that night. The ship broke into two parts before it went under. It remains more than a mile deep in the North Atlantic. The sinking of the Titanic has been documented in film and literature over the years.</p>
