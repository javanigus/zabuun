				<h1>Planning a Surprise Party</h1>
				<p> At school, Maribel confronted Drake and Minnie about it. "So, when were you going to tell me you two are dating?" Maribel said. Drake and Minnie nervously looked at each other. "We're not dating! We never would," Drake said. "I saw you two at the restaurant last night," Maribel said. "Well, we didn't want to tell you, but we were planning a surprise party for you. That's why we didn't invite you to eat with us," Minnie said. Maribel felt bad that she ruined the surprise.</p>
