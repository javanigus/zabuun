				<h1>Buy a Goat</h1>
				<p>  "I hate mowing my lawn," said Gil. "Every week I have to mow my lawn. Every week for six months I have to mow my lawn. What can I do?" "You should dig it up," said Brenda. "Take out all the grass. Pave your yard. Make a concrete yard. Then you won't have to mow it. You don't have to mow concrete. Grass grows, but concrete doesn't grow." Gil thought that was a bad idea. "That's a bad idea," he said. Concrete is hot. Concrete is ugly. Concrete is hard. "Nobody wants a concrete yard," he said. "I have another idea," said Brenda. "Buy a goat. A goat will eat all your grass. A goat loves to eat grass. Get rid of your dog. Your dog doesn't eat grass. Your dog is lazy. A goat is a hard worker." Gil said that was a good idea.  </p>
