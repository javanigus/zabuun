				<h1>The Move to Georgia (1)</h1>
				<p> Jasper flew to Georgia to look the place over. When he returned, he told Evelyn that they should put their house and mobile home up for sale. He said he would still prefer to remain in New Mexico, but the Georgia place looked all right, although small. But most important, he said, was that she would be happier living near her sisters. Evelyn was touched; how could she ever pay him back for being so considerate? </p>
