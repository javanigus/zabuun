				<h1>A Good Golf Shot</h1>
				<p>  The pin is 100 yards away. The flag on the pin moves a little. The light wind blows from right to left. He selects his club. He takes a practice swing. He looks at the flag again. He hits the golf ball. It lands on the green. It is ten feet from the hole. It is a good shot.  </p>
