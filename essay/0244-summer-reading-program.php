				<h1>Summer Reading Program</h1>
				<p>  The library had a summer reading program. It was to help promote reading in the summer. A lot of kids did not want to read after school. This fun program helped them read. There were two programs. One for kids and one for teenagers. Every 5 books they read would get them a prize. There were different prizes every time. There was also a raffle. Each book they read gave them one ticket. The more books they read, the better chance they had. The prize was a music player. Over 500 kids and teenagers participated. The reading program was a success.   </p>
