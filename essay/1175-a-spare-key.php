				<h1><b> 26. A Spare Key </b></h1>
				<p>  Laura came back home from work. She looked for her keys in her bag. It had always been there, but not now. She realized she left the keys at work. She wanted to go back to get the key, but it was closed now. No one was there. Her family was out on vacation. They cannot open the door for her. She called her mom. "I am locked out, what should I do?" she asked. "Your aunt has a spare key," her mom said. Spare keys are helpful. They are copies of the original keys. Laura smiled. She made a visit to her aunt's house.  </p>
