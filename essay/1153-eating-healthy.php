				<h1><b> 4. Eating Healthy </b></h1>
				<p>  Fast food is not healthy. It is very bad for you. But fast food is usually cheap. It is also good for people who cannot cook. It is also good for people who are in a rush. Timmy buy fast food every day. He works long hours. When he gets back home from work, he just wants to sleep. His co-workers tell him he should start eating healthy. His wife tells him that, too. He gained 40 pounds since he started working. One morning, before Timmy went to work, he saw something on the dining table. It was a lunch box with a bow on it. It was chicken salad. It was from his mom. She left a note. The note said: "Change your habits."  </p>
