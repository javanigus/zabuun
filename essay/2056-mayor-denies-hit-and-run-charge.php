				<h1>Mayor Denies Hit-and-Run Charge</h1>
				<p> The mayor of Sacrapinto, J.K. Choi, 35, was charged with hit-and-run driving last night by the town sheriff. A freshly killed calf was discovered lying in the middle of Arlington Drive at about 10:00 p.m. A witness, 20-year-old Emily Parker, said she saw the car hit the calf and keep going. She didn't see the driver but she did recognize the hood ornament on the car—a pair of bull horns.</p>
