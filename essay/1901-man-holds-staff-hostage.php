				<h1>Man Holds Staff Hostage</h1>
				<p> Morgan, who lived in a nearby town, was known for his strange behavior. He had been under psychiatric care for much of his life. FBI officials were outraged that Morgan had interrupted a busy presidential candidate. A spokesman vowed that Morgan would be thrown into jail for a long time for kidnapping, reckless endangerment, and terrorism. "Mental illness is no excuse," he declared. "This is a nation of laws, not excuses." </p>
