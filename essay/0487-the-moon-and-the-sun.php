				<h1>The Moon and the Sun</h1>
				<p>   "How far away is the moon?" Chris asked his dad. His dad said that was a good question. He said the moon was not as far away as the sun. "How far away is the sun?" Chris asked. His dad said that was a good question. He said the sun was farther away than the moon. "Did you have to learn this in school?" Chris asked. Dad said, "Yes, I had to learn this in school." Chris asked, "But you forgot it?" Dad said, "Yes, I forgot it." Chris asked, "Why did you forget it?" Dad said, "I forgot it because it isn't important." Chris asked, "If it isn't important, why are we learning it?" His dad said that was a good question. He said, "You're learning it because your teacher thinks it's important." Chris asked, "Can't you call my teacher? Can't you tell her that this isn't important?"  </p>
