				<h1><b> 50. A Bad Habit Dies Hard </b></h1>
				<p>  Maria has a bad habit. She likes to twirl her hair. She twirls her hair with her pencil. She twirls her hair with her fingers. She twirls her hair when she eats. She twirls her hair in class. She twirls her hair so much. Her parents want her to stop because it does not look professional, especially when she does a presentation. It also makes her lose her hair. They offered her $1 for every day she would not twirl her hair. Maria's eyes lit up. She was committed to not twirling her hair. She managed to earn $15. She was doing well. Then she saw a girl twirl her hair. Maria had to twirl her hair, too. She did not care about one dollar.  </p>
