				<h1>D.B. Cooper Lives On (2)</h1>
				<p> In 1980, a kid found $6,000 of the marked bills on the bank of the Columbia River, near Portland, Oregon. Had D.B. landed in the river and drowned? Had his body and most of his money eventually drifted into the Pacific? Or, had D.B. left the money there as a ruse, to make the FBI think that he had died? The FBI is angry that D.B. Cooper got away. "If we find that dirtbag, he's going to prison for 30 years," said one agent recently. </p>
