				<h1>A Seaside Painting</h1>
				<p>  It's a painting of a seaside. The main colors are blue, white, and brown. The sky is light blue. A white cloud covers half the light blue sky. Two white birds fly through the air. The bottom half of the painting is white sand and brown shrubs. At the bottom right you can see part of the ocean. The ocean is dark blue with small white waves. A boat is sailing by. The boat has four big, white sails. It has a wooden hull. An old wooden house sits on the white sand. No smoke comes from the brick chimney. The roof sags in the middle. The house has a front porch. Five wooden posts support the porch. A clothesline is behind the house. Clothes are hanging on the line. But there are no people anywhere. Maybe they are inside the house. Maybe they are walking along the beach.  </p>
