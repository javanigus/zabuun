				<h1>The Park</h1>
				<p>  Linda loves the park. There is so much to do. First, she looks at the sky. One cloud looks like a dog. Another cloud looks like a sheep. Later, she feeds the ducks. They are hungry. Linda throws bread crumbs. The ducks enjoy the food. Finally, Linda watches the sun go down. It is beautiful.  </p>
