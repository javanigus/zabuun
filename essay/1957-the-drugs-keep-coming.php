				<h1>The Drugs Keep Coming</h1>
				<p> Reportedly, drug lords have also purchased a Russian cannon that can fire a 2-ton shell 500 miles. The cannon, now hidden in Mexico, will be used to fire 2-ton packages of cocaine, marijuana, and other drugs into southeast New Mexico, where drug lords have secretly bought thousands of acres of desert land. The packages will land in  the desert, undetected by US radar. Once they land safely among the cactuses and scorpions, the packages will be stored underground. The drug lords are building a huge complex of tunnels and storage space under the New Mexico desert. The tunnels will connect to truck routes for transporting drugs to major cities. A DEA official said that even if the cannon and tunnels exist, it just proves that DEA is winning the war on drugs. </p>
