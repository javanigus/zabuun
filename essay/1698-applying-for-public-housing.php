				<h1>Applying for Public Housing</h1>
				<p>The government may visit you in your current home and interview you and people you live with. Other things the government will ask for are your birth certificate and the birth certificates of all people who will live with you and proof that you pay taxes, like a tax return. If you are eligible for any public housing assistance, you will get a letter. If you're approved, you'll be put on a waiting list. You may be on the waiting list for a long time before you actually can move into a public housing unit. This is because there are many people applying and eligible for help. Sometimes you can be waiting for years.</p>
