				<h1>A Mystery Man</h1>
				<p> It wasn't that Ed was embarrassed by his lifestyle, but rather, Ed just thought that students should focus on math. If he got too friendly with them, they might think of him as an "easy" teacher. Ed was married, with two kids and one guinea pig. Ed's hobbies included golfing and swimming. Ed was a very intelligent man and only had two close friends.</p>
