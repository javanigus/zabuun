				<h1>Body in a Barrel (2)</h1>
				<p> Before leaving, George called his mom to tell her about Staci. When he returned from Vegas, George saw his sister's face on the local TV news. Under her picture was the word "Missing." The TV reporter said that Kathy, Russell's first wife, had been accidentally shot to death while turkey hunting with Russell six years ago. Beverly, Russell's second wife, had accidentally drowned in her bathtub three years ago. George, now suspicious, put down his beer. He called the police. The officer asked if she could put him on hold for a second. George said no problem. </p>
