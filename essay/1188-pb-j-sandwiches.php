				<h1><b> 39. PB & J Sandwiches </b></h1>
				<p>  Ruth eats a lot of PB & J sandwiches. "PB" stands for peanut butter; "J" stands for jelly. It is really easy to make. It is tasty, too. She puts two slices of bread in the toaster. She takes the bread out after it is ready. The corners are burnt. She likes it like that. She scoops out some peanut butter with a knife. She spreads some peanut butter on one slice of bread. She scoops out some jelly with a knife. She spreads some of it on the other slice of bread. She puts the two slices together. She takes a bite.  </p>
