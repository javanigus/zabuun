				<h1>Shirley Temple: From Child Star to Diplomat</h1>
				<p>Her career is one of the most remarkable in Hollywood history. She made dozens of successful films as a child actress. She was very mature, and talented for someone so young, but by 1942, her films began to flop. Her career was seemingly over by her teen years, and announced her official retirement in 1950. This did not stop Temple though, as she began a second career as a public servant. She got involved with the Republican party, ran in a special election, in California, in 1967, but lost. She was then noticed by U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who offered her a diplomatic position, which she accepted. She served as ambassador to several countries during her political career under President Gerald Ford, and President George H.W. Bush</p>
