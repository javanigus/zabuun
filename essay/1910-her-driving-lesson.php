				<h1>Her Driving Lesson</h1>
				<p> He had just bought a new car—a Lincoln. It was a big, long, four-door sedan. Some days, he would go out to his beautiful car and just sit in it. But he was going to the hospital next week for a colonoscopy; he needed to give his wife some practice in driving the Lincoln. She had to drive him home after the medical procedure.

Someone had crashed into it while she was Christmas shopping at Macy's. </p>
