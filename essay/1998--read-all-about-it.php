				<h1>"Read All about It!"</h1>
				<p> PLOP! Alfred woke up, and immediately knew why he was awake—the paperboy. It was 5:30 a.m. A while later, he finally got back to sleep. Later that morning, he made a phone call.

Alfred was calling to complain about the Los Angeles Times, and he was talking to someone in India!</p>
