				<h1>Good Old Shoes</h1>
				<p>  Oscar loves his shoes. He has had them for 5 years. They still fit. They look very old. They have holes in them. There are scratches on them, too. The bottom of the shoes are even worse. "Oscar, you need to get new shoes," his mom said. "No! I love my shoes," he said. "You will get hurt if you keep wearing them," his mom said. Oscar still said no. His mom decided to surprise him. She bought him a pair of Nikes. Oscar loved them. He felt bad that he wasn't going to wear his old shoes anymore. He decided to keep them. He put his shoes in a glass case.   </p>
