				<h1><b> 51. A Cup of Coffee A Day </b></h1>
				<p>  A lot of adults drink coffee every day. It keeps them awake. At least that's what they think. A lot of people can't even think without coffee. Lucy is one of those people. She has a cup of coffee with two spoons of sugar a day. She drinks coffee while reading the newspaper. It is her routine. What happens if she does not have coffee? She goes insane. Her vision starts to blur. Her body starts to shake. She is unable to focus in class. She gets cranky. The smallest things annoy her. One time she even punched someone.  </p>
