				<h1>Family Reunion</h1>
				<p>When his cousins tried to leave, they realized that the door was locked. They began to yell for help, and Paul started laughing. All of his aunts and uncles were outside enjoying the party, so no one could hear the yells. Paul went back outside and sat down at a table. He was still laughing. An hour passed, and his aunt started looking for her son. When Paul's cousins were finally set free from the room, they started looking for Paul, because they knew he had locked them in there. Paul wasn't worried; he knew they wouldn't do anything. He looked at them, laughed, and then went back to listen to music. The cousins sat down, and got something to eat. They were all mad at Paul.</p>
