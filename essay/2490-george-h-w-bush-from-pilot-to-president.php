				<h1>George H.W. Bush: From Pilot to President</h1>
				<p>Bush campaigned for the 1980 Republican nomination, but lost to Reagan. He was, however, chosen as running mate, and the two men won the election easily. Bush won the 1988 presidential election, and became the first president to serve post Cold War. His presidency was marked by Middle-Eastern threats to the American people, primarily from Iraq's Saddam Hussein. He sent more than 400,000 troops to Kuwait after Hussein invaded its Middle-Eastern neighbor. Bush's presidency was marred by a stagnant economy, and discontent with the status quo. He lost the 1992 presidential election to Bill Clinton.</p>
