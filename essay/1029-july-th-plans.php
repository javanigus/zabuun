				<h1>July 4th Plans</h1>
				<p> After dinner, the Griffins would watch the fireworks. They had a good view of the fireworks. This year, they decided to make their own fireworks, too. The fireworks came in a lot of different colors, like blue, red, and purple. The fireworks weren't as big as the ones at the park, but they were still nice.</p>
