				<h1>Happy Hour</h1>
				<p>When Ed returned to work on Monday morning, he felt much better physically. His coworkers, however, teased him about drinking so much on Friday. His boss wondered why Ed hadn't completed all the work he was supposed to finish on Friday.  Ed certainly couldn't tell his boss that he left work early to go and drink with his colleagues.  Ed was called into his boss's office to explain. "I guess I was too happy," Ed said unhappily.</p>
