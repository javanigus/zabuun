				<h1><b> 49. A Yard Sale </b></h1>
				<p>  The Carters were having a yard sale. They needed money to buy a new refrigerator. The yard sale had old clothes, toys, books, cleaning supplies, and more. They had been preparing for two weeks. They posted ads all over the town. The son and daughter posted the information on Facebook. The parents told their friends at work. The Carters emailed people, too. A lot of people came. The Carters were surprised and happy. Not a lot of people bought anything though. The items were too expensive. Billy Carter, the son, pushed his friends to buy things. They would not. The dad made everything 30% off. This helped. A lot of people bought things after the markdown.  </p>
