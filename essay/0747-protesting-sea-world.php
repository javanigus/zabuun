				<h1>Protesting Sea World</h1>
				<p> Sea World has been under a lot of pressure lately. Thousands of people have been protesting the parks. These people say that dolphins and whales should not be forced to live in such small spaces. They should also never be forced to perform pointless tricks. Most people are starting to agree with this. Sea World will hopefully start listening to the protesters soon.  </p>
