				<h1>Christopher Reeve: A Real-Life Superman</h1>
				<p>Reeve refused to give up. He spent the rest of his years advocating for spinal cord injury advancement in treatment and technology. He used his celebrity status to help the cause, but sadly, Reeve died at the age of 52 in 2004 due to complications from his injuries. He will always be remembered to his fans as the Man of Steel though.</p>
