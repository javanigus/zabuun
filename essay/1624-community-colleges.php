				<h1>Community Colleges (1)</h1>
				<p>Community colleges provide a much-needed resource for all these students. Former military personnel, international students, and high school students alike, are all welcome. One of the best things about community colleges is that they accept anyone at anytime. This means people who have not found what they want to do in life can try more than one area of study. If they don't like one course of study, they can always try something else. That is the beauty of community colleges.</p>
