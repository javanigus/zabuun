				<h1><b> 20. Three Roommates </b></h1>
				<p>  Maria had three roommates. Living with them was hard. She thought everything would be okay. She was wrong. One of the girls was messy. She did not wash the dishes. She left her clothes on the floor. She spilled food on the table. Another girl was mean. She said a lot of mean things to Maria. The third girl was strange. She sang the same song every morning. She ate her food off a napkin. She stared at birds every day for an hour. Maria did not realize her roommates were like this. She planned to move out.  </p>
