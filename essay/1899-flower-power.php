				<h1>Flower Power</h1>
				<p> Ted's wife, Stephanie, wondered why Ted bought the new car, since he had just bought a new Cadillac two years ago. Because Stephanie liked the Cadillac so much, Ted said, it was now hers. He had bought the Mercedes for himself. Ted started staying late "at the office." He told Stephanie that he had to work extra hours to help pay for the Mercedes. She didn't mind—she was enjoying her Cadillac.</p>
