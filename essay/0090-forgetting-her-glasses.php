				<h1>Forgetting Her Glasses</h1>
				<p>  She goes to English class. She reaches into her backpack. Her glasses are not inside. She cannot see anything. Her teacher writes the sentence: "The cat chases the ball." The teacher asks the students to copy this sentence. She squints. She still cannot see the sentence. She sits closer to the board. She will never forget her glasses again.  </p>
