				<h1>The Tree Climber</h1>
				<p>  He climbs a tree. He climbs from limb to limb. He climbs higher and higher. The ground gets farther away. The top of the tree gets closer. He sees a squirrel. It "barks" at him. He looks down at the people on the ground. His mother looks up in the tree. "Get down here right now!"  </p>
