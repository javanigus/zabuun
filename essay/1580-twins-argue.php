				<h1>Twins Argue</h1>
				<p>  Derrick was arguing with his twin brother. They were 52. Their mom had died two months ago. They were arguing about her estate. She had no will. Who gets what? "What's there to argue about?" asked the family lawyer. "You split everything down the middle. You're twins. You each get half." Derrick disagreed. He was older. He was born first. He was one minute older than his brother. He should get 60 percent, not 50 percent, of the estate. His brother and the lawyer laughed. Derrick shot both of them. He shot them in the face. He got into his car. He drove around the countryside. He saw 12 people walking along the road. He shot them all. He shot most of them in the face. He killed 12 people and wounded 12 others. Then he shot himself in the face. "I guess he just snapped," said a British policeman.  </p>
