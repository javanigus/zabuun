				<h1>Passion for Pizza</h1>
				<p> Clark graduated from college with a degree in chemistry. His parents were so excited for his future. "You're going to make a great doctor!" they always said. Clark did not want to be a doctor. All he wanted was to open up his own pizza place. "That's ridiculous," said his mother. "Think about how much money you could make as a doctor!" Clark did not care about money. All he wanted was to spend every day making, smelling, and eating pizzas.  </p>
