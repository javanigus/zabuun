				<h1>A Night in Las Vegas</h1>
				<p>Matt and Jake arrived first at the place where the concert was going to be. They called the sisters, and told them where to meet them. Nancy was excited to see the concert, because one of her favorite bands was playing. As they got in line to get in, Jennifer went to the restroom. When Jennifer was getting back to her friends and sister, she met one of the members of the band named Jill. Jennifer told Jill about Nancy coming all the way to Las Vegas to see this show, and if she could do something special for her. Jill smiled and said sure. She reached into her purse and gave Jennifer four backstage passes. Jennifer hugged Jill and said thank you. Jennifer ran back to Nancy, and told her to close her eyes. When Jennifer told Nancy to open her eyes, she was holding up the backstage passes in front of Nancy. Nancy began jumping up and down with joy.</p>
