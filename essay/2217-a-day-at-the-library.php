				<h1>A Day at the Library</h1>
				<p>As they were looking for the book, Claudette was in one aisle and Steven was in another. Claudette took out a book and saw Steven was looking at her. She smiled and he told her she was beautiful. She was happy he said that, because she really liked him. Claudette asked him if he wanted to be her boyfriend. Steven said yes. As they were hugging, Claudette's dad came in and saw them. He split them up and took Claudette by the hand. He told Steven that he wouldn't be able to see her again. Steven was sad.</p>
