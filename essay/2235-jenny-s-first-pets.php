				<h1>Jenny's First Pets (1)</h1>
				<p>Jenny's dad was surprised when he found out what pet his daughter had chosen. "I want a horse," she declared when she walked back into her dad's bedroom. "How about something a little less expensive," he said to Jenny. "A pony?" she cleverly replied. "Let's go to the pet shop," Jenny's dad said.</p>
