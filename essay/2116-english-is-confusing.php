				<h1>English Is Confusing</h1>
				<p> "The present participle tells us what emotion or feeling the subject is causing. For example, 'Grammar is boring' means that the subject—grammar—causes an emotion of boredom. If we say, 'The movie is interesting,' we are saying that the movie causes a feeling of interest. If we say, 'The roller coaster is exciting,' we are saying that the roller coaster causes a feeling of excitement. Any questions so far? Am I confusing you? Is everyone confused?"</p>
