				<h1>Black Friday</h1>
				<p> The day after Thanksgiving has become America's wildest shopping day. Closed all day on Thursday, chain stores all across the nation open early on Friday. Some stores open at 12:01 Friday morning, while others open at 4 a.m. Some "sleepyhead" stores, like Target this year, don't open their doors on Friday until 6 a.m. From Friday to the day before Christmas, this is the season when businesses make as much as 25 percent of their annual revenue. This season puts many businesses "in the black"—that is, into profitability—for the year.</p>
