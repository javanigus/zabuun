				<h1>Ten Pushups</h1>
				<p>  Up, down. Up, down. Billy was doing pushups. His arms were bent. His palms were on the ground. His toes were on the ground. His back was straight. His belly was close to the ground. His nose was close to the ground. Then he straightened his arms. Now his nose was almost two feet above the ground. His back was straight. His arms were straight. His head was higher than his feet. His feet were lower than his head. That was one pushup. Then Billy bent his arms. His nose and belly almost touched the ground. Then he straightened his arms again. That was another pushup. Billy did eight more pushups. He did ten pushups. He did ten pushups every day.  </p>
