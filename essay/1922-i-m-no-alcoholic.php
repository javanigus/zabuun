				<h1>I'm No Alcoholic!</h1>
				<p> "Who cares?" Brigham asked. "It doesn't interfere with my work. I've never killed anyone while driving. In fact, I haven't even gotten a ticket for drunk driving. Not only that, but I'm a better driver with a buzz than most people are when they're sober. Why should I quit? I enjoy my beer—it makes me feel good. It takes the edge off a tough day. I don't do crazy things, and I don't get mean and angry after I have a few. Most of the time, I drink at home, alone, watching TV. I'm not bothering or hurting anyone. What harm is there in that?"</p>
