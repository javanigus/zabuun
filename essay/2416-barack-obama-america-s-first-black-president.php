				<h1>Barack Obama: America's First Black President</h1>
				<p>Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii in 1961. He is a graduate of both Columbia University in New York City, and Harvard Law School. Before becoming president, he served as senator for the state of Illinois. He is considered a liberal by many southern conservatives, but this may be an unfair label. The perception is largely due to the Affordable Care Act, and his attempts at immigration reform. Additionally, Obama ended the U.S. involvement in the Iraq war. He also ordered the military operation that eventually resulted in the death of Osama Bin Laden. Obama was reelected as president in November, 2012.</p>
