				<h1><b> 5. Exercising Together </b></h1>
				<p>  Emily and Crystal are best friends. They both want to lose weight. They exercise together. Doing things together makes things fun. Emily tried exercising by herself. She thought it was too boring. She could only run for 30 minutes before getting bored. Crystal tried exercising by herself, too. She does not like being alone. She feels more comfortable with Emily. They go to the park three days a week for an hour. They stretch for 10 minutes. They run for 20 minutes. They jump rope for 20 minutes. They play some type of sport for the last 10 minutes.  </p>
