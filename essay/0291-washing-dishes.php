				<h1>Washing Dishes</h1>
				<p>  The Smiths take turns washing dishes. Mom washes dishes on Monday. Dad washes dishes on Tuesday. Samantha washes dishes on Wednesday. Then the cycle starts all over again. Today is Wednesday, so it is Samantha's turn. Samantha takes the dirty dishes from the dining table. She puts them in the sink. She squeezes a drop of soap on the sponge. She washes the dishes with the sponge. She sings to herself to make the job easier. She rinses the dishes off with water. She dries them with a towel. She puts them back in the dish holder. She wants to buy a dishwasher.   </p>
