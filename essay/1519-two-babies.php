				<h1>Two Babies</h1>
				<p>  She wanted to have two babies—one boy and one girl. She wanted to have the boy first and the girl a year later. That way they could grow up together. He said that was okay with him. She said, "What do you mean, 'okay'? It shouldn't be 'okay' with you. You should say that you want two babies just as much as I do. If you don't want two babies as much as I do, then forget it." He asked, "Forget it? You mean that we won't have two babies unless I really want to have two babies?"  She said, "Yes, that's right. If you don't really want two babies, then we won't have two babies." "Okay," he said, "then let's not have two babies." "Are you sure about that?" she asked. He nodded his head, "Yes, I'm sure. We can't afford even one baby." "Okay," she said. "Goodbye." "What do you mean, 'goodbye'?" he asked. She told him she was going to leave him. She was going to find a man who wanted to have two babies with her. He told her that he was just kidding—of course he really wanted to have two babies with her. "Too late," she said. "You already told me how you really feel."</p>
