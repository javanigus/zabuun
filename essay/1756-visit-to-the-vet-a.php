				<h1>Visit to the Vet (A)</h1>
				<p>"Mike, we have to take the cat to vet," she said. When Mike asked why, Maria said it was time to give him shots. Mike saw how concerned Maria was and forgot all about punishing Tiger. "Alright, you're right. When do you want to go?" he asked Maria. Maria said she would make an appointment right away. She grabbed her cell phone, and called the vet to make an appointment.</p>
