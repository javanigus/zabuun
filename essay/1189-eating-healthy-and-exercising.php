				<h1><b> 40. Eating Healthy and Exercising </b></h1>
				<p>  Mr. Brown is a physical education teacher. He used to be a professional gymnast. His students always ask him how to lose weight. Mr. Brown always says to eat healthy and exercise regularly. That's it. He thinks that people know this, but they don't want to do it. People are lazy. They want to find easy ways out. His students asks him about diet pills. Mr. Brown says that diet pills have side effects. They are not as effective as exercise. "Exercising is tiring, but it's the right way to lose weight."  </p>
