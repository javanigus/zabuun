				<h1>Meeting the Neighbor (A)</h1>
				<p>Mike had completely forgotten about the conversation and let out a reluctant groan. "Do we have to, Maria? How about we do it next week?" he said. "No, we could do it today, right now," she replied. Maria went to the bedroom to quickly put on her shoes. She came back with Mike's shoes as well and threw them in front of him. He reluctantly put them on. Maria pulled Mike off the couch and dragged him all the way to their neighbor's front door. She rang the doorbell. A man answered the door.</p>
