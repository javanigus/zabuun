				<h1>Jenny's First Pets (2)</h1>
				<p>Jenny and her dad finally got around to see the cats and dogs. "It's either one or the other," Jenny's dad said, pointing to the cats and dogs. Jenny had to think long and hard on which pet to get. After what seemed like an eternity, Jenny looked up at her dad and said, "I can't choose one". Her dad paused for a minute, smiled and said to her, "Then choose two". Jenny went home with a white cat and a black dog, which were the best birthday present she had ever received.</p>
