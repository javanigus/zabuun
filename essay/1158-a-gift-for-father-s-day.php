				<h1><b> 9. A Gift for Father's Day </b></h1>
				<p>  Carl is a father. This year he told his family not to get him anything for Father's Day. The truth is he does want gifts. He just wants to see if his family really know him or not. Carl's wife knows him well. She ends up getting him a gift. She gave him a watch. Carl's daughter knows him well, too. She bought him a rare table. Carl's son does not know him that well. His son really thought Carl did not want anything. "Son, I was just testing you!" Carl said. His son felt bad. "How about a hug?" he asked Carl. Carl opened his arms. A hug is the best gift a father can get.  </p>
