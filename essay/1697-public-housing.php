				<h1>Public Housing</h1>
				<p>To find out if you are eligible for public housing, you need to visit a government housing assistance office close to you. You can find your local housing assistance office by checking the yellow pages or by looking online. You will have to fill out an application. On the application you will need to list the names, gender, and date of birth of all people who would be living in the house or apartment.</p>
