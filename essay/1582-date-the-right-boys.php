				<h1>Date the Right Boys</h1>
				<p>  Paul had been a Marine for 17 years. He couldn't wait to retire. "I've enjoyed it," he told his brother Sam, "but I'll also enjoy leaving it." He wasn't sure what he was going to do after retirement. He definitely would spend more time with his daughters. His girls were seven and nine. "They see me for awhile, and they don't see me for a longer while," Paul said. He planned to retire in five years. His girls would be twelve and fourteen. "That'll be perfect," he said. "I want to be home every night. Teenage girls need dads at home to watch over them. And I'll be there to make sure they don't date the wrong boys." Paul didn't want his girls to follow in his and his wife's footsteps. They had gotten married right after high school. He wanted his daughters to stay single and go to college.  </p>
