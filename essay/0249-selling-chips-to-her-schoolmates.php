				<h1>Selling Chips to Her Schoolmates</h1>
				<p>  Sally does not want to get a job. She is too lazy. Also, she does not like following orders. She wants to be her own boss. Sally wants to make some easy cash. She has an idea. She buys thirty packs of chips for fifteen dollars. She then sells them to her schoolmates for a more expensive price. She sells the chips for $1 per bag. The bad thing is that Sally is not allowed to do this. It is against the school policy. She must be secretive about it. She sells during lunch period. People come to her. They sit at her table and pretend they are talking to her.   </p>
