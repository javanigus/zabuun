				<h1>Meet Halfway</h1>
				<p>  He stopped at the motel. It was late at night. It was almost midnight. He asked the motel clerk, "Do you have a vacant room?" She said she had a vacant room. He asked how much it was. She said it was $100 for the night. "But the night is half over," he said. "Can I pay half price for the room?" She said yes. "But there is one condition," she said. "If we only get half, you only get half. You must sleep on only one-half of the bed. You can use only one of the two pillows. The bathroom has hot and cold water faucets. You can use only one faucet. The cable TV has 100 channels. You can watch only 50 channels."  </p>
