				<h1>Eye Problems</h1>
				<p> Stella knocked on her friend's door. There was no one inside! Her friend had just left. Stella couldn't drive back home. She would definitely get in a car accident. Stella waited outside her friend's doorstep. Eventually, she fell asleep. When her friend came back, Stella was too tired to drive, so she just stayed at her friend's house again.</p>
