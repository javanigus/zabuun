				<h1>USPS Redelivery (1)</h1>
				<p>  Rob was in Texas. He went to the post office. He mailed a package to Jean. He insured the package. Jean lived in New York City. She lived in an apartment building. The apartment building has 20 floors. It has a front desk. The front desk is on the ground floor. Security people work at the front desk. A week later, Rob's package was in New York City. The mailman took it to the front desk. "I have a package for Apt. 3A. It's insured. Someone has to sign for it," he told Victor. Victor said, "I'll ring Apt. 3A to see if anyone is home." He rang the apartment. There was no answer. "No one's home," he told the mailman. "Would you ring again?" asked the mailman. "I don't like to redeliver packages." Victor rang the apartment again. Nobody answered. The mailman left a postal form in Jean's mailbox.  </p>
