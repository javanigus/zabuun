				<h1>Put an Ad on Craigslist</h1>
				<p>  The phone rang. "How's New York?" Wally asked. "I love it," Eugene said. "Have you found a job?" Wally asked. "Of course I haven't found a job," Eugene said. "I only got here a month ago." "You'd better hurry up," said Wally. "Your savings will run out before you know it." "I'm looking," said Eugene. "But it's tough. Thousands of people are looking for work. But there aren't thousands of jobs." "You should try Craigslist," said Wally. "Many people in New York want to improve their English. They will pay you good money. Look on Craigslist. See what other English teachers are charging. Charge a few dollars less." "That's a good idea," said Eugene. "But should I charge less or more? If I charge less, they might think I'm not so good. If I charge more, they might think I'm very good." "Put TWO ads on Craigslist," said Wally.  </p>
