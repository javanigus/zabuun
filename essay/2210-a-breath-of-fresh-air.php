				<h1>A Breath of Fresh Air</h1>
				<p>Sam would ride his bike in the morning because he loved getting a breath of fresh air. In the past when he smoked, the only time he got a breath of fresh air was when he went out for a cigarette. He enjoyed being outside breathing in the air that would hit his face as he rode his bike through the town.</p>
