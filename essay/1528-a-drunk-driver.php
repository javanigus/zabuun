				<h1>A Drunk Driver</h1>
				<p>  The policeman saw the car. The car was speeding. Richard was driving the car. The speed limit was 35 mph. Richard's car was going 50 mph. The policeman turned on his siren and flashing lights. He caught up to Richard. But Richard didn't pull over. Richard was drunk. He was drinking a cold beer. He was listening to loud music. He was having a good time. Finally he noticed the siren and flashing lights behind him. Richard pulled over. He stopped the car and turned off the engine. He threw the can of beer out the window. The cop walked up to the car. He picked up the can of beer. "Is this yours?" he asked. "No, sir," Richard said. "It's cold," the cop said. "There's still some beer in this can. I bet your fingerprints are on this can." The cop told Richard to get out of the car. He told him to tilt his head back and close his eyes. He told him to touch his nose with his finger. Richard got dizzy. He lost his balance. He started to fall. The cop grabbed him. He put Richard into the back seat of his police car. He told Richard, "You shouldn't drink and drive." "I know that," Richard said. "Everybody knows that," said the cop. "But they still drink and drive."  </p>
