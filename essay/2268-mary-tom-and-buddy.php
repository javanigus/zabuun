				<h1>Mary, Tom, and Buddy (1)</h1>
				<p>"It's not safe for someone like you to be walking at night all alone," Tom said. "I'm not alone. I have Buddy," Mary replied. "You should have somebody accompanying you and Buddy on nights like these," said Tom. "Would you like to tag along, Tom?" Mary asked. Tom was too struck to answer. He had been waiting for this moment to happen.</p>
