				<h1>Dwight D. Eisenhower: From General to President</h1>
				<p>He was a moderate Republican who favored a balanced budget and social programs. He continued former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs to help boost the economy, and championed education rights for all Americans. Eisenhower intended to only serve one term in office, but the Republican party was in danger of losing control of both the House and the Senate. He was convinced to run in 1956, and beat Adlai Stevenson in a landslide victory. One of his greatest domestic moves was the development of an interstate highway system, which created jobs, and stimulated the economy.</p>
