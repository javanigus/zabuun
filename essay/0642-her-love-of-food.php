				<h1>Her Love of Food</h1>
				<p> She ate a lot of food. She ate cheese burgers. She ate chips. She ate sweets. Every day she ate these types of foods. She was always hungry. She did not like vegetables or fruits. She never drank water. She only drank soda, or juice. She was big. She did not exercise. She was happy about her appearance. People made fun of her. "Lose weight," people said to her. "Stop eating," people said to her. "No, thank you," she replied. "I'm happy with how I look," she said. She loved eating fattening foods. Nothing could change her diet. She went to see a doctor. The doctor told her to lose weight. She did not want to lose weight. Her doctor explained why she had to lose weight. She could die. She became scared. She did not want to die. She decided to lose weight. </p>
