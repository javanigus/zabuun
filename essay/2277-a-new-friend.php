				<h1>A New Friend</h1>
				<p>Benjamin's sister apologized to Sandra and scolded Benjamin saying, "Benjamin, apologize! Why did you do that?" Benjamin replied yelling, "Because she killed my men and stepped on castle!" Sandra then noticed she was standing right on his toy soldiers. Sandra then apologized and Benjamin's sister began to laugh at her and said, "Don't worry about it! I'm Jessica. What's your name?" The two began talking. It was the beginning of a new friendship.</p>
