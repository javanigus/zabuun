				<h1>Bilingual Is Better</h1>
				<p>Being bilingual or even multilingual is controversial, though. Some parents worry that switching among different languages will confuse their children. Some people feel that in the United States everyone should speak English only. There are even organizations asking the U.S. Congress to pass laws making it illegal for the government to use any other language on official documents. This movement has not been very successful.</p>
