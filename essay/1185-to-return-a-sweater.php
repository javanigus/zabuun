				<h1><b> 36. To Return a Sweater </b></h1>
				<p>  Carol wanted to return a sweater she bought last week. It was too big. She went to the store she got it from. "Hi, I would like to return this," she said. "I'm sorry, we do not do returns. We only do exchanges," the cashier said. Carol was getting mad. "I want my money, not your clothes," Carol said. The cashier asked for her receipt. Carol handed it to her. The cashier pointed to the back. It says "only exchanges can be made." Carol hit her hand on the counter. The cashier jumped back. Carol asked for the manager. The manager came over. "I'm going to ask you to leave the store, miss," the manager said.  </p>
