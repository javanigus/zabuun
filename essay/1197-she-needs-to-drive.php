				<h1><b> 48. She Needs to Drive </b></h1>
				<p>  Emma lives in California. It is hard to get around without a car. Most people drive. Very few people take the bus or walk. Emma wants to drive, but she can't afford a car. Her job pays a minimum wage. She lives with her brother and his family. They took her in, because they felt sorry for her. She walks to work every day. She wishes she did not have to. She has not saved enough money to buy a car. Even if she has, she cannot afford car insurance. Since she cannot get a car, it is useless for her to learn how to drive.  </p>
