				<h1><b> 8. Choosing a College </b></h1>
				<p>  There is a lot that goes into choosing a college. The location is important. The type of people there is important. Whether it is public or private is important. The number of students is important. The popularity of the college is important. Jessica is choosing between Treewood University and Sunset College. Treewood University is close to her home. She likes that. Treewood University is a private university. That means it is expensive. Jessica does not like that. Sunset College is a lot cheaper, but its reputation is not as good as that of Treewood University. Jessica has a tough decision to make.  </p>
