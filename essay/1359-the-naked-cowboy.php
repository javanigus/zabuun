				<h1>The Naked Cowboy</h1>
				<p>  It was January in Manhattan. It was a mild, sunny day. A man stood at 42nd Street and Broadway. His blond hair hung down to his broad shoulders. He was wearing a cowboy hat. He was wearing cowboy boots. He was wearing tight, white underwear. He wasn't wearing a shirt. He wasn't wearing pants. Written on the back of his white underwear was "The Naked Cowboy." He was playing his guitar. People stopped to look at him. A young couple looked at him. The woman was laughing. She said something to her boyfriend. She said something to the cowboy. He waved her over. She walked over to him. He put his muscular arm around her. Her boyfriend took a picture. She gave the cowboy a $5 bill. He put it into his guitar. Another woman walked over to him. He put his arm around her. Her friend took their picture.  </p>
