				<h1>Airport "Security" (1)</h1>
				<p>  The airport guard stopped the tall man. The man was trying to walk past the guard. The guard told him to use the entrance. "You cannot enter here," he told the man. "You can only exit here." The man nodded his head. He understood. He stood outside the security rope. He was only a few feet from the guard. The man's girlfriend was going on a business trip. She was flying to Texas. He wanted to kiss her goodbye one more time. He stood outside the exit. The guard started talking on his cell phone. Then the guard stood up. He left his chair. He walked away. He continued talking on his phone. The man watched the guard walk away. Then the man ducked under the rope. He walked past where the guard had sat. He walked over to his girlfriend. She was standing in line. He hugged her.  </p>
