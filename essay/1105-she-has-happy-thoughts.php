				<h1>She Has Happy Thoughts</h1>
				<p>  She has happy thoughts. She thinks about good things. She thinks about good people. She controls her thoughts. Sometimes she has a negative thought. But she quickly pushes it out of her mind. She "changes the channel." She listens to only happy thoughts. Happy thoughts keep her happy. She feels good. She sleeps well.  </p>
