				<h1><b> 28. Saving Water </b></h1>
				<p>  California is in a drought. We should save water. Turn off the faucet when you are brushing your teeth. Try to take five-minute showers. Rake your leaves instead of using a hose. Water your plants early in the morning. Repair dripping faucets. All the droplets add up. Or at least put a bucket under the faucet. Use that water to water your plants. Make sure your home is leak-free. Don't use too much water when washing the dishes. Do not flush more than necessary. Do not flush paper down the toilet. Do not water your streets. Together, we can save water.  </p>
