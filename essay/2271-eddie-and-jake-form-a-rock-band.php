				<h1>Eddie and Jake Form a Rock Band</h1>
				<p>After learning a handful of songs, Eddie and Jake both felt ready to perform in front of an audience. Eddie and Jake got their acoustic guitars and performed at an open music night at the local community center. The audience roared with thunderous applause after Jetsam's set ended. Eddie and Jake bowed and thanked the audience for coming.</p>
