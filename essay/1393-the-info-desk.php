				<h1>The Info Desk</h1>
				<p>  This was his first visit to the corner library. He walked over to the library information desk. The woman behind the information desk was reading a magazine. He stood in front of her. She continued reading the magazine. He cleared his throat. She looked up from her magazine. "I'm looking for a book," he said. "Title?" she asked. "'Good Manners, Bad Manners,'" he said. She typed the title into her computer. "Downstairs," she said. "How do I get downstairs?" he asked. She tilted her head to her right. "The stairs are over there?" he asked. She tilted her head to her right again. "Is there a restroom downstairs, too?" he asked. She tilted her head to her left. "The restroom is over there?" he asked. She tilted her head to her left again. "Do you have a sore throat?" he asked. She didn't answer. She was reading her magazine.  </p>
