				<h1>A Free Breakfast for Everyone</h1>
				<p>  Denny's is a popular restaurant. They are in all the big cities in America. They serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They are open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. To please their customers, Denny's announced a special event. On Monday after the Super Bowl, they offered a free breakfast to everyone in America. The free meal was a Grand Slam breakfast. The breakfast was from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. They told everyone to bring their appetites, not their cash. The delicious meal included pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausages. People got up at the crack of dawn to beat the rush. Ben and Mary woke up at 5 a.m. Monday. They got dressed and drove to Denny's. They got in line at 5:20. "Oh, my," said Mary. "There's a hundred people in front of us. Look how long this line is already. We should have come here at 4:20." The line moved slowly forward. Ben started talking to the man behind them. His name was Brad. Brad had brought his wife, their five kids, and his brother's four kids. "What a deal, huh? I only wish we had more kids to bring," Brad said. "They say there's no such thing as a free lunch. But today Denny's is showing America that there is such a thing as a free breakfast."  </p>
