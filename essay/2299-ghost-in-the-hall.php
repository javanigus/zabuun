				<h1>Ghost in the Hall</h1>
				<p>"Alvin, what are you doing?" Levi said right before Alvin could open the door. "I think there's a ghost in the hallway," Alvin replied. Levi rose to his feet and went to the door. "I'll go with you." Levi said. The two opened the door together and popped their heads out the door to take a look. "You see, it was nothing," Levi said. Alvin and Levi went back to bed. Levi again fell asleep before Alvin. Alvin could not go to sleep. There was someone walking in the hallway.</p>
