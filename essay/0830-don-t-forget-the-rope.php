				<h1>Don't Forget the Rope</h1>
				<p> The woods were full of bears. Bears can smell food from very far away. Rope is used to tie the food to a tree. This stops the bears from eating it. "Don't worry," said Thomas. "There probably aren't any bears here anyway." Then the boys went to sleep. When they awoke, all their food was gone. There were giant paw prints all around their tents.  </p>
