				<h1>Running a Mile</h1>
				<p>I tried tying a rope around the shorts to make them fit, but they wouldn't. The bell rang, and I knew my teacher would be mad if I didn't get out there. I started running, and barely got there before he started calling names. After he finished with the roll call, we started the test. The whole class set off running. I was doing okay at the beginning. After a while, people started passing me. A lot of people laughed at my shorts. Then it happened. One guy pushed me out of his way, and I ended up falling. My shorts fell first, and then I fell to the ground. That was when all the girls started passing me. One of them shouted, "Ew, he doesn't have clean underwear." I picked up my shorts, and walked the rest of the mile. It was the most embarrassing moment in my life.</p>
