				<h1>Taking Care of Mom and Dad</h1>
				<p>Nursing homes are controversial, however. There have been cases across the country of staff in nursing homes abusing and even robbing the elderly residents. There are different state and federal agencies that are supposed to oversee nursing home facilities. Some people feel that it should be the responsibility of family members, especially adult children, to care for their aging or ill parents. However, many adult children have their own children and families to take care of, and do not have the means to care for their elderly parents; others worry about medical skills needed if their elderly parents are seriously ill.</p>
