				<h1>Every Day is Your Last</h1>
				<p> Every day, she tried to do something meaningful, and every day, she wrote in a diary. The day after getting discharged from the hospital, Kathy tried a new ice cream flavor. She usually gets vanilla, but she tried chocolate fudge and loved it. She also went sky diving. At school, Kathy started joining more clubs. In a weird way, she was glad she got hit by a car.</p>
