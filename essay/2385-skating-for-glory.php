				<h1>Skating for Glory</h1>
				<p>As Brian prepared for his jump, he kept looking at the girls that had gathered to see him. He was breathing heavy, but he knew he could do it. The time had arrived. Brian was ready to try it again. He pushed off the pavement, and started pedaling his skateboard faster and faster. He got to the top of the stairs and then he jumped. Brian was in the air for about 5 seconds and then he landed. The girls all applauded, and then Brian stopped his skateboard. He had done it. He beat his record. All the girls went up to give him a hug, but they all stayed away because he smelled. He started laughing. Everyone laughed and congratulated Brian.</p>
