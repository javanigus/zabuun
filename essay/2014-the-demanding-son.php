				<h1>The Demanding Son</h1>
				<p> Luke didn't know what to do. He wanted to yell at Kyle, his fiancée's son, because Kyle continued to argue with his mom. She didn't even demand very much from him. "Study hard, get the best grades you can," she told him. She tried to get it into his head that she didn't have the money to pay for his college education. Not a cent. Instead of studying harder, however, Kyle spent hour after hour playing video games on his computer. He waited until the last minute to study for school tests, and then stayed up all night cramming for them. When Jane tried to remind him that he needed good grades so that he could get a grant or a scholarship, he would get angry. He said it was her responsibility to take care of him financially until he graduated from college. </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .35in; line-height: 150%"> "Where did he get that idea?" Luke asked. "You've raised him for 10 years all by yourself. You don't owe him a thing. With his attitude, he should be glad you haven't kicked him out of the apartment already. He graduates from high school next year. When I was in the eleventh grade, my father made it clear to me that when I graduated from high school, I was expected to leave home. Yet Kyle thinks you have to pay his way through college!" " </p>   <center><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <!-- ResponsiveIndex970x90 --> <ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-4240992229388079"      data-ad-slot="8135245216" data-ad-format="auto"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); </script></center>   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .35in; line-height: 150%"> Jane wouldn't allow Luke to talk to Kyle. "He doesn't like you telling him what to do. He says you're not his father, so why should he have to listen to you?" </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .35in; line-height: 150%"> "Well, his father's dead. He should appreciate that I'm around to try to help him." Maybe Kyle would learn to accept Luke's help and advice in time, Jane said. </p>   </font><center><hr><center><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <!-- ESL728x15 --> <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:728px;height:15px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4240992229388079" data-ad-slot="4358907616"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); </script></center><hr><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <!-- multi336x280 --> <ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-4240992229388079"      data-ad-slot="2332180818"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); </script>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<script type="text/javascript"><!-- google_ad_client = "ca-pub-7363809219244122"; google_ad_width = 336; google_ad_height = 280; //--> </script> <script type="text/javascript" src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"> </script> <script>   var _comscore = _comscore || [];   _comscore.push({ c1: "8", c2: "14880948" ,c3: "3" });   (function() {     var s = document.createElement("script"), el = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; s.async = true;     s.src = (document.location.protocol == "https:" ?
