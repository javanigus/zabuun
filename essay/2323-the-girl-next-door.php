				<h1>The Girl Next Door</h1>
				<p>As they were walking back to their house next door, James looked back and noticed Linda was looking at him through the window. James looked at her, and Linda smiled. When they got home, James went to his new room. He took a look outside his window, and noticed that he could see Linda in her room. He couldn't help looking at her. He thought she was the prettiest girl he had ever seen. As James was looking at her, he heard his mother calling. "I'll go downstairs in a moment, mom," James said as he turned away from the window. When James looked back to Linda, she was staring right at him. James fell down to the floor, and said in a whisper "Oh, no. I hope she didn't see me. Oh, please. Please." Linda saw him, and laughed. She thought James was cute.</p>
