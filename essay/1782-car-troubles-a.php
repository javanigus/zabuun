				<h1>Car Troubles (A)</h1>
				<p> Mike's car had been his pride and joy for the last ten years that he had owned it. It took him everywhere he needed to be, and never failed to do so. It was a nice black car with four doors, leather seats, and a stick shift for changing gears. Mike was cautious about who he allowed to drive his car. In fact, he hardly let his own fiancée, Maria, drive it.  </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .35in; line-height: 150%"> One day, as Mike was lounging in the living room, Maria asked to borrow the car. "Mike, I need to use your car because mine is out of gas," she thoughtfully asked. Mike, cautious as he was, was reluctant to lend out his car. He questioned Maria in hopes that she would take back her request. "Your car had absolutely no gas?" he said, sounding mildly irritated. Maria assured him that her car had completely run out of gas, and that she needed to go get a tank of gas from the gas station.  </p>   <center><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <!-- ResponsiveIndex970x90 --> <ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-4240992229388079"      data-ad-slot="8135245216"      data-ad-format="auto"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); </script></center>   <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .35in; line-height: 150%"> Mike thought for a few seconds, and proposed an alternative solution to his soon-to-be wife. "Why don't I just go to the gas station to buy gas, saving you the trouble of going yourself?" he said. Maria did not mind this solution, and allowed her soon-to-be husband to go to the gas station for her. She thanked and kiss him goodbye before he stepped out the door. "Drive safely Mike," she said from the door as he got inside his car. "You know I always do honey," he cheerfully replied with a smirk showing his confidence.  </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .35in; line-height: 150%"> Mike pulled out of the drive way, and made his way to the gas station. He returned within the hour with the gas tank in hand. On the drive back, Mike had noticed a noise he'd never heard his car make before. Out of concern, he decided to take the car to his mechanic that afternoon. "Maria, I'll be back. I'm going to the mechanic to see what's wrong with my car," he said to her after handing her the tank of gas. Maria, well aware of how much Mike loved his car, tried to console him.  </p>   <center><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <!-- multi336x280 --> <ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-4240992229388079"      data-ad-slot="2332180818"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); </script>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <script type="text/javascript"><!-- google_ad_client = "ca-pub-7363809219244122"; google_ad_width = 336; google_ad_height = 280; //--> </script> <script type="text/javascript" src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"> </script> <script>   var _comscore = _comscore || [];   _comscore.push({ c1: "8", c2: "14880948" ,c3: "3" });   (function() {     var s = document.createElement("script"), el = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; s.async = true;     s.src = (document.location.protocol == "https:" ?
