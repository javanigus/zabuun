				<h1>Mark Twain: A Great American Author</h1>
				<p>Twain was a prolific writer who penned several books, and other publications. Most of his writing was taken from his life in the western part of the United States while traveling with his brother Orion. He was born Christian, but later in life questioned his faith, and developed negative feelings toward organized religion. He was once quoted as saying, "If Christ were here, now there is one thing he would not be - Christian." Twain died in 1910 from a heart attack at the age of 74.</p>
