				<h1>Going to the Circus</h1>
				<p>  Every week, there was a field trip for Kennedy Middle School. This week the field trip was the circus. All the kids gathered at school in the morning. They were talking and running about. Everyone was super excited. They got on the bus and drove to the circus. At the circus they all sat together. There were popcorn and lemonade sold. When the show began, all the kids watched intensely. There was loud music. There were performers and dancers. When the animals came out, everyone stood up. There were lions, elephants, and tigers. All the kids loved the show. This was one of their favorite field trips.   </p>
