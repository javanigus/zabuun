				<h1>The Fire in the Hills (2)</h1>
				<p> Adam's brother called from a nearby city. "Are you going to have to evacuate?" he asked Adam. Adam said if they told everyone to evacuate, he would just put his laptop in his car and drive over to stay with his brother. Adam was amazed at how huge and menacing the fire had gotten in less than 24 hours. He hoped that the winds would die down soon; this situation was a little scary. Just a couple of embers flying southward could result in hundreds of homes, including his own, burning down. He did not want his home to be on the five o'clock news. </p>
