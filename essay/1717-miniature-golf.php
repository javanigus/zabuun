				<h1>Miniature Golf</h1>
				<p>Golf arcades are not limited to playing miniature golf. Some arcades include mini-car racing on a small, professional-like race track. It is fun to test a person's skills against others in a mini-car race. If racing is not something of interest, there are other activities available. Video games and pinball are popular. The food is another attraction at golf arcades. Most golf arcades serve American favorites like hot dogs, hamburgers, and pizza with all the trimmings. A golf arcade is really a great way to spend a Friday, or Saturday night.</p>
