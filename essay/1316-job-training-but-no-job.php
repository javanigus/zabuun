				<h1>Job Training, but No Job</h1>
				<p>  Many homeless people were sitting on the sidewalk. A young man walked up to each homeless person. He gave each person a flier. The flier was from a trade school. The flier described a class. The trade school was offering a barber class. The class was free for homeless people. Matt read the flier. He talked to the man. Matt said he wanted to take the class. The man wrote down Matt's name. He told Matt to go to the school on Monday. "How long does the class last?" Matt asked. "The class lasts eight weeks," the man said. "Will the school find me a job?" Matt asked. "No, you have to find your own job," the man said. "We can only do so much."  </p>
