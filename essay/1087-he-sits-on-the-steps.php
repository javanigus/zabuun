				<h1>He Sits on the Steps</h1>
				<p>  He sits on the subway steps. He calls out to strangers. He holds out his cap. He asks for help. He asks for money. He asks for change. Some strangers stop. They hand him a quarter. They hand him a dollar. Most strangers pass by. They give him nothing. They are in a hurry.  </p>
