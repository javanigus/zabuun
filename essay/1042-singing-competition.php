				<h1>Singing Competition (2)</h1>
				<p> Teresa sang a Mariah Carey song for the second round. The judges said she was good, but it wasn't great. They recommended that she sing an opera song since her voice could go really high. Teresa sang an Italian opera song and the crowd went wild. Since then, Teresa decided to change her singing style. Singing opera made her stand out.</p>
