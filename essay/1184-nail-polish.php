				<h1><b> 35. Nail Polish </b></h1>
				<p>  Nancy likes nail polish, but she is not that good at putting it on. It is harder than it looks. She is going to try it though. She takes a look at her mom's nail polish collection. There are over thirty colors. She likes the light blue one. She lies down on her bed. She starts with her left hand first. She paints each nail. It smells bad. She blows her nails so that they dry faster. She starts on her right hand. It is harder to paint the nails on the right. This is because she is right-handed. It takes a lot longer to paint her nails. Her right hand does not look as nice as the left hand.  </p>
