				<h1>Smoking Causes Tooth Decay</h1>
				<p>  New York City's mayor is against smoking. Stores that sell cigarettes must display big anti-smoking ads. One ad shows a decayed tooth. The ad says, "Smoking Causes Tooth Decay. Quit Smoking Today. Call 311 or 1-866-NYQUITS." Store owners are upset. They say the ads violate their free speech. Their free speech allows them to display only the ads they want to display. They don't want to display anti-smoking ads. The ads hurt their cigarette sales. The ads hurt their business. City officials said consumers must know the facts. They must know that smoking is dangerous. The store owners are suing the city. But one store owner said, "The ads don't bother me. Everyone knows that smoking is dangerous. Is there a person in this country who doesn't know that? Smokers don't look at those ads. Smokers don't care about their health. All they care about is their next cigarette."  </p>
