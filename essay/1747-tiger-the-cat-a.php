				<h1>Tiger the Cat (A)</h1>
				<p>Maria was excited about getting a pet. She had always wanted to own a cat ever since she was a little girl. Her parents never allowed her to due to her brother being allergic to cats. She had a dog growing up instead, but it was not the same. There was something about cats that attracted Maria to them more than dogs. Cats are peaceful and clean. Maria could relate to them more than dogs. Mike, on the other hand, did not mind cats. He just wanted to make Maria happy. He knew getting a cat for Maria would make her happy. Mike and Maria were driving to the pet shop.</p>
