				<h1>James Bond: Filmdom's Greatest Spy</h1>
				<p>All of Bond's films have three things in common. They all feature guns, cars, and beautiful leading ladies with exotic, and often erotic names. Some of the most famous actresses to appear in Bond movies are Jane Seymour, Ursula Andress, Britt Ekland, Maud Adams, and Diana Rigg. The most recent film was 2012's Skyfall starring Daniel Craig. The franchise is not showing signs of decline.</p>
