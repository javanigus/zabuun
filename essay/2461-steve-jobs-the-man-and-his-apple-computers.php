				<h1>Steve Jobs: The Man and His Apple Computers</h1>
				<p>Jobs branched out his financial kingdom venturing into other businesses such as Pixar Animation Studios, which was also very successful. He briefly left Apple to found the NeXT Corporation, which produced both software and hardware, but NeXT floundered, and Jobs went back to Apple to develop iPhone and iPad. Jobs was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003, and eventually lost his battle with cancer in October, 2011.</p>
