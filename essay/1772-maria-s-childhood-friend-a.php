				<h1>Maria's Childhood Friend (A)</h1>
				<p>Maria told him not to worry, that it was an old girlfriend from high school. Maria grabbed her bag and said goodbye to Mike. "I'll be back in a couple of hours," she said to Mike and kissed him good-bye. She drove her car a few miles away to the sandwich shop. She sat down at a table and waited for Mary to arrive. A few minutes later, Mary walked in through the door and spotted Maria sitting down. She walked over to her.</p>
