				<h1>Abraham Lincoln: America's Greatest President</h1>
				<p>Lincoln vowed to end slavery during his campaign for president, while never speaking about how the country would keep its relationship with the southern states when slavery was ended. This angered many southerners who promised to rebel if Lincoln won. The war lasted four years, and about 620,000 soldiers died. In what is considered the turning point of the war, Lincoln issued his famous Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863. What it did was gain international favor from the world because of its ethical qualities. It put pressure on those countries doing business with the south to review their practices. It effectively put an end to the war. Lincoln was assassinated on April 15, 1865 by a southern sympathizer as he sat in a theater with his wife.</p>
