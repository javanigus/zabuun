				<h1>Meeting the New Neighbor</h1>
				<p>  Hayden's neighbor moved out a month ago. Hayden was happy. She hated her old neighbor, who played music loudly. Because of that, Hayden could not focus on her homework. A new neighbor moved in yesterday. Hayden wanted to say hello. Hayden knocked on her neighbor's door. A girl of her age opened the door. "Hi, how can I help you?" she asked. "I just wanted to say hi. I'm your neighbor," Hayden said. "Oh cool! I'm Betty. "Do you go to George Cramer high school?" Hayden asked. "Yes!" Betty said. Hayden was happy. They could study together.   </p>
