				<h1>The Super Cheap Jacket (1)</h1>
				<p>  He wondered if it was cold outside. He was going to walk to Pier 88. He looked outside his window. Many people on the sidewalk below were wearing short-sleeve shirts. But the radio said the temperature was 67 degrees. That's not exactly hot, he thought. It was only 10 a.m. It would warm up by noon. He put on jeans and a T-shirt. He walked outside. It was a little chilly. Maybe it will get warmer as I walk, he thought. But it didn't. He went into Conway, a budget clothing store. Maybe I can find something warm and cheap, he thought. He went upstairs to the men's department. He found a long-sleeve shirt in the $2 section. Then he saw a jacket in the $4 section. It was much heavier than the shirt. Neither the shirt nor the jacket had a price tag. He took them to the cashier.  </p>
