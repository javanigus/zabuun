				<h1>Why the Sky Is Brown</h1>
				<p> Ramsey said to bring the car by 8:00 a.m. Monday through Friday--"first come, first served." Cory got there at 7:40 a.m. Monday. There were three cars already parked there, but Cory was relieved to discover that they were the mechanics' cars. He was the first customer. Ramsey introduced himself, saying, "Coffee will be ready in a few minutes. I'll show you the waiting room." He was a friendly, courteous man. Cory felt comfortable. Moe had sent him to a good place.  </p>
