				<h1><b> 23. Big Cell Phones </b></h1>
				<p>  Cell phones are getting bigger and bigger each year. They can't fit any pockets. That is okay though because people always hold their cell phones. They have their cell phones in their hands. The first cell phones that came out were actually very big. Year after year, they got smaller. Ever since smartphones came out, cell phones got big again. People look at their cell phone screens a lot. If their phones were small, it would be bad to their eyes. Some people joke that cell phones will be as big as computers.  </p>
