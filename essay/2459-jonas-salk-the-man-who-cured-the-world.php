				<h1>Jonas Salk: The Man who Cured the World</h1>
				<p>Polio had baffled medical science since its discovery in the mid-19th Century. When Salk turned his attention to the disease, there was little hope that anyone could find an adequate cure. Salk developed his vaccine in the early 1950s, and in April of 1955, his accomplishment was heralded in newspapers across the country. Salk became a national hero. His vaccine effectively ended the polio epidemic in the United States and many countries around the world.</p>
