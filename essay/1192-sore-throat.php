				<h1><b> 43. Sore Throat </b></h1>
				<p>  Dorothy had a sore throat. The sore throat started last night. She woke up from her own coughing. She did not know why she got a sore throat. Did she get it from a classmate? Did she get it from her family? Did she swallow something sharp? Dorothy got sick about twice a year. That was pretty normal for kids. She did not want to go to the doctor. She tried to hide it. She could not. She could barely talk. Her parents took her to the doctor. Dorothy had to drink cough syrup. It tasted really bad. It made her sleepy, too. She drank a lot of water to get rid of the taste. Hopefully, her throat would get better soon.  </p>
