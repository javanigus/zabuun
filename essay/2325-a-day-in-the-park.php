				<h1>A Day in the Park</h1>
				<p>Charles asked the brothers if they wanted to play a game of 2 on 1, they happily said yes. Charles won, of course, but he told the brothers that they were really good. Charles then told the brothers that he was starting a basketball camp at his old high school, and if they were interested; they could join it for free. The brothers had heard about it, and said that they would love to join. "We just have to ask our mother," Scott said. Charles laughed, and said, "Of course, you don't want to get mom mad." The two brothers ran back home, and they told their mom about what had happened at the park. She told them that they could join as long as they kept up with their homework and their classes. The brothers agreed, and went back to the park to practice.</p>
