				<h1>A Trip to Hawaii</h1>
				<p>"Where are we going?" Roger nervously asked. "Over there," said Will, as he pointed to the ocean. He started getting nervous, and started breathing heavy. Helen went over to Roger and calmed him down. "They're probably in their honeymoon," people said as they passed Roger and Helen. Roger laughed. He finally calmed down. He went out to the ocean with Will, and tried to surf. Every time he tried to get on the surf board he ended up falling. When they got back to the land, Helen hugged Roger and kissed him. "You did great, honey. I love you," Helen said. Roger knew she was lying, but he had never seen Helen smile so greatly. He let it go.</p>
