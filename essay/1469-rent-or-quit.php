				<h1>Rent or Quit</h1>
				<p>  Karen had a new job. She was a real estate agent. Clients called her up. Clients emailed her. Clients wanted an apartment. Karen showed them apartments. The clients didn't like the apartments. Karen showed them more apartments. The clients still didn't like the apartments. She showed many apartments to many clients. But nobody rented an apartment. Tanya was Karen's boss. Tanya yelled at Karen. "You have worked here for four months," she yelled. "You haven't rented one apartment yet. You are no good. You should quit. You should find another job. You are not a good real estate agent." Karen said, "I am a good real estate agent. But my clients have a big problem. They all want a penthouse, but they only have enough money for the basement." Tanya said that was not her problem. That was Karen's problem. "I will give you two more weeks," Tanya said.  </p>
