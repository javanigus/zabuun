				<h1>Gasoline Prices Hit Record High</h1>
				<p> A young man pumping gas said he had waited in line for 20 minutes. When asked why he didn't go a block away where there were no lines, he said, "Every penny counts. When I bought this '99 Bummer, gas was only $1 a gallon, which was pretty cheap. So, even though I only get eight miles per gallon, I wasn't paying that much to fill my tank. But today's prices are killing me. I drive to work, and I drive to the grocery store. That's it. I used to drive around the neighborhood just to show off my wheels, but I can't do that any more." </p>
