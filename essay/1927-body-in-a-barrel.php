				<h1>Body in a Barrel (1)</h1>
				<p> The barrel was very heavy. He asked Russell if the whole engine was inside the barrel.  Russell just grunted. Once they got it outside, they rolled it to the back of Russell's pickup truck. George helped Russell position a metal motorcycle ramp behind the truck, and they pushed the barrel slowly up into the bed of the pickup. When they finished, George told Russell that this was a "two case" move, meaning two cases of Budweiser. Russell told him no problem. </p>
