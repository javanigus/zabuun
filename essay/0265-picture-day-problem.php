				<h1>Picture Day Problem</h1>
				<p>  At North High School, students had to wear a uniform. Picture Day was special though. On Picture Day, students could wear whatever they want. Girls took this chance to wear dresses. Boys took this chance to wear casual clothes. Jimmy wanted everyone to notice him. He wore a shirt with a curse word on it. He walked proudly in the hallways. People noticed him. His plan definitely worked. A teacher saw him. He was in trouble. He ran away. He ran inside the girl's bathroom. No one would find him in there.   </p>
