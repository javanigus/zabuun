				<h1>Fishing with Dad (A)</h1>
				<p>"That's smart thinking! I already like him better than your last boyfriend," said Henry with a laugh. Maria chuckled and rolled her eyes. She kissed Henry and Mike goodbye. Mike and Henry were going fishing without Maria. Maria told Mike not to worry and watched them drive away to the quarry. They reach the quarry and set up the equipment. They rented out a boat and embarked on the fishing trip.</p>
