				<h1>The Haunted Warehouse</h1>
				<p>That night he was sitting at his desk when he heard what sounded like someone knocking on the door leading to the warehouse. William dismissed it as a drum "popping," and ignored it. A few moments later, the sound was back, and this time it was louder. Since there was no one else in the building, he became a bit nervous, but continued working. Soon the noises got louder and louder. The final straw was when he heard someone walking above the ceiling of his office. This scared him quite a bit, but again he ignored it. Finally, it happened again, and this time William ran into the warehouse to look above his office, but no one was there. After that, William never worked at night again.</p>
