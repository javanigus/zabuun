				<h1>Who Needs School?</h1>
				<p> The dropouts do not see a bleak future for themselves. In the report, one student was asked why he had dropped out of the tenth grade. "School was boring," he said. "I got a life to live. There's women, parties, fast cars, and easy money on the street, if you know where to find it. And if things ever go south, all I gotta do is apply for welfare. They'll put me up in an apartment, and give me food stamps and free medical care. Why do I need an education or a stupid job?" </p>
