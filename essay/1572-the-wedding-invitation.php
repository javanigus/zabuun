				<h1>The Wedding Invitation</h1>
				<p>  Tom's second cousin was getting married in early June. Tom hardly knew his second cousin. They rarely spoke to each other. Tom spoke to Ed's mom more often. Tom hoped he wouldn't get an invitation. He disliked weddings. They reminded him of his own wedding. His wedding was okay, but the marriage was a disaster. Ever since, he had seen weddings as doors to disaster. He disliked spending money. An invitation meant he'd have to respond yes or no. Even if he responded no, he'd still have to send a gift. That was $100 out the window. He disliked traveling if it involved more than a short ride. If he responded yes, he'd have to take a two-hour bus ride. But if he responded no, people might be insulted. Families expect family members to attend their weddings. On May 30, Tom hadn't gotten an invitation. He felt relieved and insulted.  </p>
