				<h1>Sleep in the Car</h1>
				<p>  He had very little money. It was cold outside. It was winter. But he was inside. He was inside his apartment. Right now he was okay, because he was inside his apartment. But next month he would not be okay. Next month he would be outside his apartment. He had lost his job. He couldn't pay his rent. He had called his landlord. He asked his landlord if he could stay an extra month for free. His landlord said no. His landlord said, "If you can't pay the rent, you must go." Where could he go? He would sleep in his car. But a car is a cold place in the winter. He was very sad.  </p>
