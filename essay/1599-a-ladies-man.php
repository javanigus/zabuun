				<h1>A Ladies' Man</h1>
				<p>  His brother told him the news. Their dad was on the move again. He had bought a ticket. He was going to visit Ireland. His flight would leave in August. Their mom wasn't going. She had gotten sick on their last trip. They had traveled to South America. She didn't know if it was something she ate or something she drank. But she was sick for a week. Their trip had lasted two weeks.  "That's it," she said. "I'm never leaving home again. If I'm going to be sick, I want to be sick in my own house." Dad didn't mind traveling alone. He made friends easily. He liked to joke. He liked to dance. He was a real ladies' man. Mom didn't care. She wasn't worried that he might cheat on her. "He's 82!" she said. "If he can cheat at his age, he belongs in the record books."  </p>
