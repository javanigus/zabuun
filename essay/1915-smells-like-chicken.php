				<h1>Smells like Chicken</h1>
				<p> "That's a terrible idea," exclaimed Rose, a secretary for the Department of Defense in Alexandria, Virginia. "First of all, I'm a vegetarian; the scent of cooked meat appalls me. Secondly, I belong to PETA—People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. And we all know how terribly chickens are treated before they are butchered. The whole idea is disgusting. And what makes it even worse is that they plan to foul the air every workday with fried chicken odor. Once a month would be bad enough, but once a day?"</p>
