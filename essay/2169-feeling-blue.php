				<h1>Feeling Blue</h1>
				<p> The blue-ring octopus likes to sneak up on its favorite food—crabs. The crabs are sometimes as big as the octopus. But the octopus is often able to "hug" the crab tightly with its eight tentacles. As soon as the octopus gets a good grip, it injects its toxin into the crab's body. Sometimes it will inject its toxin directly into the crab's eye. The toxin kills the crab quickly.</p>
