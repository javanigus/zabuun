				<h1>First Day of College</h1>
				<p> It was the first day of college. He needed to get ready soon. He jumped out of bed, and put on his clothes. He brushed his teeth and grabbed his backpack. He soon went out the door. His school was not far. He rode his bike. He arrived in twenty minutes. The school was huge. He got lost. His first class was at eight. He asked for directions. Someone gave him a map. He followed the map to his class. He was five minutes late. The class ended. He had another class. He used the map to find it. He was not late this time. His second class ended. It was time to go home. Tomorrow he had to return. He was excited. </p>
