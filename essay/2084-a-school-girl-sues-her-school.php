				<h1>A School Girl Sues Her School</h1>
				<p> The school principal, who grew up in India, said that he supported Ms. Smith 100 percent. He said that Virginia is an excellent student who would have no problem getting into the best universities even with a C in cooking. "She won't have any difficulty finding a great university, but she might have problems finding a husband," he laughed. "She'd better look for a man who likes to eat out a lot." </p>
