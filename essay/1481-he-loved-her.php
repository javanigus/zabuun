				<h1>He Loved Her</h1>
				<p>  The man set the woman on fire. She was a dancer in a night club. The man came to the night club once a month. He asked the woman for her phone number. She said no. "I don't even know you," she said. "Why would I give you my phone number?" He told her that he was in love with her. She told him that he was crazy. How could he be in love with her? He didn't even know her. He didn't know anything about her. He finished his drink and paid for it. He left the night club. He sat in his car in the parking lot. She was glad that he left. Later she went outside to smoke a cigarette. The man got out of his car. She did not see him or hear him. He poured gasoline on her and threw a match on her. She was on fire. She started screaming. She ran into the night club. The manager put the fire out with his jacket. But her face and hands were badly burnt. No one would ever ask for her phone number again.  </p>
