				<h1>Disappearance of a Lego</h1>
				<p>Mike didn't want to stick anything up his son's nose to try and take out the mini toy brick out. He was scared he would push the Lego up higher and hurt his son. "I guess we have to go to the hospital," Mike told his son. Rob looked scared. It was a short drive to the hospital emergency room. Mike felt like the most negligent dad in the world when he told the triage nurse the reason for the visit. "My son has a Lego stuck up his left nostril," Mike said in a low voice.</p>
