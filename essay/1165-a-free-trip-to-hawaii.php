				<h1><b> 16. A Free Trip to Hawaii </b></h1>
				<p>  Elizabeth has always wanted to travel. She has never been on a plane. She has never been on a boat. She has been on a train. She has never even been in a car. She lives in a place where everything she needs is close by. Elizabeth's dream is to visit Hawaii. She thinks it's beautiful. All the beaches and flowers seem great. One day, she saw an ad saying "Enter raffle to go to Hawaii for free!" She put her name on a piece of paper. She put it in the big box. There were a lot of papers. She did not think she would win. It was a big surprise when she got a phone call. "Hi Liz, congratulations! You just won a trip to Hawaii!" a man said. Elsa jumped up and down.  </p>
