				<h1>Don't Drink and Drive</h1>
				<p>I have to update my insurance policy, and deal with the Department of Motor Vehicles. You waste a lot of time and money. It gets difficult to get a job, because you have to let your future employer know that you have been arrested. It's not worth it. If you are thinking about going out to celebrate and party with friends and family, do one of the following: get a designated driver, take the bus or train, or call a cab. It may cost you a little bit of money, but compared to how much money you will lose if you get a DUI, it's nothing. Don't drink and drive.</p>
