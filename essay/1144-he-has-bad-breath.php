				<h1>He Has Bad Breath</h1>
				<p>  He talks to a stranger. The stranger backs away. The stranger offers him chewing gum. He accepts it. He goes home. He goes into the bathroom. He brushes his teeth. He scrapes his tongue. He opens a bottle of mouthwash. He gargles with it. He rinses his mouth with water. He feels better.  </p>
