				<h1>The School Dance</h1>
				<p>On the night of the dance, Charles and Richard entered the gym as the mascots. They were dancing and running around the dance floor as mascots are supposed to do. Then the principal came up to say a few words and introduce the school band. Charles and Richard had a plan though. After the band started playing, they got behind the principal and started carrying him. The principal started yelling, but Charles and Richard didn't listen. They started walking closer and closer to the pool that was on the other side of the gym. Before the principal realized what was going to happen, they let him go directly into the pool. Everyone started laughing. Charles and Richard ran out of the gym quickly. No one realized they were Charles and Richard. Of course, the next day they got caught. They were really in trouble.</p>
