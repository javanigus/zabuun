				<h1>Two Babies</h1>
				<p>  She wanted to have two babies—one boy and one girl. She wanted to have the boy first and the girl a year later. That way they could grow up together. He said that was okay with him. She said, "What do you mean, 'okay'? It shouldn't be 'okay' with you. You should say that you want two babies just as much as I do. If you don't want two babies as much as I do, then forget it." </p>
