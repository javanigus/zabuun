				<h1>Register to Vote</h1>
				<p> Because of alleged widespread voting fraud, Arizona has become the first state in the union to require that voters show proof of US citizenship. To register—or reregister—to vote, Arizona residents must now show a birth certificate or passport. Reregistration is required whenever a resident changes addresses. This requirement will cause problems for citizens who have lost their birth certificate or who don't have a passport</p>
