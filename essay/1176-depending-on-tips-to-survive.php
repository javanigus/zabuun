				<h1><b> 27. Depending on Tips to Survive </b></h1>
				<p>  Franklin works at a cafe. He only gets nine dollars an hour. He depends on tips to survive. He works very hard to give good customer service. He smiles at everyone. He tells jokes to customers. He is fast at handing out food. One day, however, he came across some stingy customers. They were teenagers. He overheard them "Let's not give tip, dude. We don't have to," said a customer. Franklin was sad to hear that. He could not ask them to give tips though. He would probably get fired if he did. He decided to treat them badly. They weren't going to give him a tip anyways.  </p>
