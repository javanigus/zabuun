				<h1>The Artist, the Poor Man, and the Musician</h1>
				<p>A few hours had passed, and the homeless man started getting hungry. He walked around in town, and saw a young musician playing outside a café. The homeless man sat down and started listening to the music played by the musician. A waiter from the café came out and told the homeless man that he had to leave, because he wasn't buying anything, and other people wanted to sit down and enjoy the music. The musician saw this and told the waiter to leave him alone and that he would like to buy the homeless man something to eat. The waiter looked at the musician and said okay. The homeless man thanked the musician. After he finished eating, he took out the ten-dollar bill and gave it to the musician. The homeless man left.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent: .35in; line-height: 150%">After the musician had finished playing at the café, he decided to go to a local art festival with his girlfriend. As they were walking around and looking at all the different paintings and sculptures, the musician's girlfriend saw a sculpture she liked. It was a young man helping out an older man who had fallen down. She wanted to buy it, but didn't have enough money. The musician told her not to worry. He pulled out ten dollars, and gave it to the artist. As the musician and his girlfriend walked away, the artist looked at the ten-dollar bill, and smiled. "Well, look at that, you found your way back home," said the artist.</p>   </font><center><hr><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <!--___noise___ 1002--> <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:728px;height:15px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4240992229388079" data-ad-slot="4358907616"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); </script><hr><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script> <!--___noise___ 1001--> <ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:inline-block;width:336px;height:280px" data-ad-client="ca-pub-4240992229388079" data-ad-slot="8077378816"></ins> <script> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); </script>  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  <script type="text/javascript"><!-- google_ad_client = "ca-pub-7363809219244122"; google_ad_width = 336; google_ad_height = 280; //--> </script> <script type="text/javascript" src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"> </script> <script> var _comscore = _comscore || []; _comscore.push({ c1: "8", c2: "14880948" ,c3: "3" }); (function() { var s = document.createElement("script"), el = document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0]; s.async = true; s.src = (document.location.protocol == "https:" ?
