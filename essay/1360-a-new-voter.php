				<h1>A New Voter</h1>
				<p>  Oscar had just moved to New York City. He registered to vote. A week later, he received his voter card. Now he was a registered voter. He read the voter notice from the Board of Elections. It said to call VOTE-NYC if he had a question. He had a question. He wanted to use an absentee ballot. But the notice said the absentee ballot was for ill people. The ballot was for physically disabled people. He wasn't ill. He wasn't physically disabled. He called VOTE-NYC. "I'm not ill. I'm not physically disabled. But I want to use an absentee ballot," he said. "Give me your address. I'll mail you an application today. You'll receive an absentee ballot before every election," Louis said. "But isn't there a problem?" Oscar asked. "The notice says I have to be ill. I have to be physically disabled." "Don't worry. We'll rewrite that," said Louis.  </p>
