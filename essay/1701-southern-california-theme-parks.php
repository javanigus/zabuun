				<h1>Southern California Theme Parks</h1>
				<p>Another famous theme park in the L.A. area is Magic Mountain, which is located in Valencia, California, just a few miles north of the Los Angeles basin. It also features world-class rides and attractions, and has been featured in several Hollywood films, including the original Vacation movie with Chevy Chase. These three parks form the core of Southern California-based theme parks, but there are more theme parks in the region including Legoland, Sea World, Universal Studios, and the California Adventure next to Disneyland. These are just some of the major attractions Americans can visit to have a good time in Southern California.</p>
