				<h1>Buying a New Television (A)</h1>
				<p>"This television is indestructible," he told Maria. As soon as he finished his sentence the television turned off and made a crackling sound. Mike jumped to his feet when he noticed smoke coming out of the television. "My television!" Mike wailed. The old television had broken. Maria panicked a little when she saw the smoke. Mike immediately pulled the plug before anything else happened. He threw out the broken television in thrash. Mike could not live without television. He told Maria if she wanted to go with him and buy a new one. Maria said yes, and the two were off to the electronic store.</p>
