				<h1>Lucille Ball: America's Sweetheart</h1>
				<p>Ball was successful in landing acting jobs, almost immediately. She starred in a series of "B" movies, and met her first husband, Desi Arnaz, while filming <i>Dance, Girl, Dance</i>. This was the start of a film career that included 72 movies. Her biggest role came on TV though. Her show <i>I Love Lucy</i> debuted in 1951, and depicted the couple's life in New York City. It was one of the most popular shows in the history of television. Ball had become a bona fide star, and <i>I Love Lucy</i> is also the most syndicated show in history.</p>
