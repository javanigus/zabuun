				<h1>A Visit to Statue of Liberty</h1>
				<p>When we got to her house, she showed me her room and told me we would be leaving for the Statue of Liberty in an hour. I took a shower and put on two sweaters. We got a taxi, and went to see the Statue of Liberty. It took a while, but we finally got to the island. I couldn't believe the Statue of Liberty was right before my eyes. I started crying, and felt my parents were right here with me. I always felt like a foreigner in this country even though I was born here. Now I understood why they wanted to visit the Statue of Liberty so much.</p>
