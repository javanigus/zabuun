				<h1>Bad Toilet Paper</h1>
				<p>  He needed to blow his nose. He pulled four sheets off the roll of toilet paper. What's this, he wondered. The first two sheets were 2-ply. The next two sheets were mostly 1-ply. He pulled six more sheets off the roll. The first four sheets were mostly 1-ply. The last two sheets were 2-ply. How do they make toilet paper wrong, he wondered. Maybe the whole roll was no good. Maybe all the rolls were no good. He blew his nose. His wife came home. She went into the bathroom. She came out of the bathroom. She was holding about ten sheets. Some were 2-ply. Some were mostly 1-ply. "What's this?" she said. "I don't know," he said. "Sometimes they make mistakes." "I've used toilet paper my whole life," she said. "I've never seen this problem before. Was this on sale? Did you get a good deal on it?"  </p>
