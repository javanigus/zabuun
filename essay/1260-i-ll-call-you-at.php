				<p>  Carol and Mary are friends. Carol said she would call Mary at 7 o'clock. Carol didn't call at 7:00. She didn't call at 7:15. She finally called at 7:30. She apologized for calling so late. Mary said it was ok. But it wasn't ok. Mary didn't like people to lie. This wasn't the first time Carol had lied. This was the fourth time Carol had lied. Mary did not trust Carol. Carol would never be her best friend. A best friend tells the truth. A best friend doesn't lie. A best friend does not call late. A best friend does not arrive late. A best friend is always on time.  </p>
