				<h1>Dinner Smells Good</h1>
				<p>  He was in his bedroom. He smelled food. The food smelled like chicken. It smelled good. A neighbor must be cooking dinner, he thought. But how could he smell his neighbor's dinner? The smell couldn't come through his apartment's heating vent. That vent was for his apartment only. So where was the smell coming from? He walked to the front door. He opened it. There was no smell in the hallway outside the door. He walked into the living room. There was no smell in the living room. He walked back into the bedroom. He could smell the food again. The bedroom was the only place he could smell the food. It was winter. All the windows were closed. How could the smell get into the bedroom? "Call up the landlord," his wife said. "Maybe he knows how. I'm just glad we're smelling chicken. I'm glad it's not fish!"  </p>
