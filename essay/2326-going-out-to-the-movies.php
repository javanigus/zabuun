				<h1>Going out to the Movies</h1>
				<p>Robert had to go outside and buy another ticket for "Godzilla." He felt embarrassed, because he had to stand in the line with the popcorn and soda. The people in line and the people who worked in the ticket booth looked at Robert and found him funny. Robert knew that they were looking at him, because they knew he got kicked out for trying to sneak into another movie. His face turned red. He thought about calling his brothers to get out, so that they could go home. Robert thought about how his brothers wanted to see the movie too, and so he bought the ticket and went back in. The security guard looked at him again, and asked him for his ticket. Robert showed it to him, and went into the theater. The security guard laughed.</p>
