				<h1>Pretty and Dumb</h1>
				<p> At the end of the class, Aria told the teacher she was dropping. Ms. Sanchez said, "Don't drop, because then you're proving them right. Show them you're capable of using your brain. Share your thoughts out loud in class, and work on getting As on your essays." Ms. Sanchez was right. She would never get rid of her "dumb" reputation if she dropped the class.</p>
