				<h1>Impolite to His Brother</h1>
				<p> "Why were you so rude to your brother?" Gladys asked. "He drove all the way over here to deliver that package to you. But you didn't invite him inside your apartment. You didn't offer him anything to drink or eat. Then, when he was talking to me, you kept telling him to speak faster. He was speaking slowly because he knows my English isn't that good—he was just being polite. Finally, when he and I sat down in the living room, you just went to your computer and started typing away." </p>
