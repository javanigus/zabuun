				<h1>Summer Programs for Kids</h1>
				<p>June didn't understand the sacrifices her mother had to make for her. She was just excited to attend the summer program. She had never been in summer camp before. June was especially excited because her friends would be there with her. Sometimes summer was boring especially since her mom worked all day. June heard there would be games and crafts. She was going to make something nice for her mom to thank her.</p>
