				<h1>George Washington: The Father of His Country</h1>
				<p>Another landmark moment for Washington was the winter at Valley Forge. In 1777, Washington led an army of more than 11,000 troops into Valley Forge in Pennsylvania, where the army suffered through a cold winter that claimed the lives of 3,000 men. When the spring arrived, instead of a demoralized, beaten group of soldiers, the army emerged battle ready, and able to continue the fight against the English in New York. The army was able to survive the fierce winter because of the training, and preparedness of Washington's officers. Washington earned the nickname, "The Father of His Country," because of his military intelligence, and his concern for the people of the United States.</p>
