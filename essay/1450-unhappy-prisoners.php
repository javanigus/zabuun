				<h1>Unhappy Prisoners</h1>
				<p>  "Where is the mustard?" asked a prisoner. "There is no mustard," said the cook. "We ran out of mustard. We have no more mustard. We'll get more mustard tomorrow." The prisoner looked at his hot dog. A hot dog without mustard is not a hot dog. "I can't eat this hot dog without mustard!" he yelled. "A hot dog without mustard is not a hot dog. I want some mustard!" The other prisoners heard him yelling. They started yelling, too. "We want mustard! We want mustard!" The cook said, "Shut up! Eat your hot dogs! We have plenty of mayonnaise. Put mayonnaise on your hot dogs." The prisoners were angry. "Don't tell us to shut up!" they yelled. They threw their hot dogs at the cook. They threw their hot dogs at the guards. They threw their hot dogs at one another. They threw their hot dogs without mustard everywhere.  </p>
