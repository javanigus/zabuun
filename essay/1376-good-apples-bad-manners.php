				<h1>Good Apples, Bad Manners</h1>
				<p>  Ellie spoke to the tour agent. The price for the 3-night bus tour was good. Her cousin Vicky called her. Ellie told Vicky about the tour. Vicky liked the price. She said she and her husband would come, too. On Saturday, Ellie and her young son met Vicky and her husband at the tour agency. Ellie brought snacks for the four of them. Vicky didn't bring any snacks. Ellie told Vicky to take some snacks. Vicky didn't like the cookies. She didn't like the energy bars. She liked the apples. She put all 12 apples in her bag. She didn't leave even one apple for Ellie's young son. "These are not my favorite apples," Vicky told Ellie. "But they are better than those other snacks. Everyone needs to eat fresh fruit daily." Ellie was polite to Vicky during the trip. After the trip ended, she never spoke to Vicky again.  </p>
