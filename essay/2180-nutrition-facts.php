				<h1>Nutrition "Facts"</h1>
				<p> With the federal government's approval, processors use labeling that helps to sell the product, regardless of how confusing or deceptive the label is to the consumer. If a consumer sees "200 calories" on a can of tuna fish, he might not buy it because 200 is a lot of calories. But if the consumer sees "20 calories" (because the can of tuna fish has 10 servings!), he doesn't worry that the can contains too many calories. All he sees is the number 20. That makes him happy, and it makes the processor happy. </p>
