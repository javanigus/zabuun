				<h1>A Day at the Beach</h1>
				<p>After the game, the girls wanted to cool off, so they decided to jump into the ocean for a little relief. The water was crowded, but that just added to the fun. It was cool and wet, and the waves were just right. Some people were surfing both on surfboards and body boards, while others were swimming out to the buoys. On the coastline, two girls were digging for sea shells and one man was using his metal detector to find hidden treasure. Carol ran up to the man and asked him what he was looking for. He said: "Anything I can find, young lady.' Carol laughed and asked him if she could try. "Sure. Why not?" said the man. So Carol started scanning the beach and soon found a necklace, whcih the man let her keep. "Why not," said the man. "You found it." Carol was very happy and ran to tell Laura.</p>
