				<h1>Hungry Abel</h1>
				<p>"When is mom coming back?" Abel asked Mel. "I don't know" he replied. Abel could now only hope that his mom would come to the rescue and bring a large fresh pizza from Pizza Mountain. Abel plopped down next to Mel on the couch and started watching television with him. They both laughed out loud at the cartoon's funny characters. Abel was enjoying himself so much that he had forgotten that he was hungry. Then commercials began playing. Abel's stomach started calling for food again. "I'm going to starve to death," Abel said, as the front door to his house started opening. "I'm back, and I brought pizza!" Abel's mom said as she came in through the door. Abel could not wait to get his hands on the pizza.</p>
