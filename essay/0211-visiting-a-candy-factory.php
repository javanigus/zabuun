				<h1>Visiting a Candy Factory</h1>
				<p>  Charlie was going to visit a candy factory. He was going with his parents. On this trip, he would take a tour of the factory. He would be with other children and their families. At the end of the trip they could fill up one bag of the candy they wanted. He was very excited. He was in a group with three other families. They took a tour of the factory. They saw how the chocolate and candy were made. It was fascinating to see what happened before it went into their mouths. At the end of the trip they each got a plastic bag. Charlie filled his up with sour candy, chocolate, and soda candy. He was very happy.   </p>
