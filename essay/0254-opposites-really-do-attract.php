				<h1>Opposites Really Do Attract</h1>
				<p>  Sandy and I were opposites. Sandy was pretty. I was ugly. Sandy was dumb. I was smart. Sandy's parents were divorced. My parents have been married for 30 years. Sandy was athletic. I was clumsy. Sandy was shy. I was loud. Sandy was liked by everyone. Some people hated me. Sandy was funny. Everyone laughed at her jokes. I couldn't even tell a joke. Sandy was clean. I was dirty. We were very different obviously. But we were still friends. We have been best friends since 1st grade. We will go to the same college. We won't be roommates though. I guess what they say is true. Opposites really do attract!   </p>
