				<h1><b> 29. She Loves Drawing </b></h1>
				<p>  Pam loves her job. She is an artist. She mostly draws portraits. People go up to her. They pay $45. They sit down on a chair. She draws them. It takes about one hour to draw one person. She does not make a lot of money because she does not get a lot of customers. People think $45 is too much. There have been days when she does not get any customers. She draw the portraits in Chinatown, Los Angeles, California. She is thinking of going to another place. She loves drawing. She just hates that she doesn't get a lot of customers.  </p>
