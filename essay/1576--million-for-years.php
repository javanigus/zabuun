				<h1>$10 Million for 20 Years</h1>
				<p>  An innocent man spent 20 years in jail. He got out when he was 58. Two years later, New York City awarded him $10 million. Alan had been convicted of murdering a woman. He hadn't murdered that woman. He hadn't murdered anyone. He was innocent. A cop had murdered the woman. That cop had testified that Alan murdered the woman. The jury believed the cop. Everyone trusts cops. The cop later went to jail. Alan said getting out of jail was the happiest day of his life. He thought he was going to die there. "It's terrible to be locked up for something you didn't do," he said. "It's terrible when nobody believes you." Alan was pleased with the award. But he said nothing would ever make him happier than getting out of jail. Not even $10 million. "The money is real nice," he said, "but nothing compares to freedom."  </p>
