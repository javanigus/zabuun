				<h1>Airport "Security" (2)</h1>
				<p>  They kissed and said goodbye one more time. Then the man left. The airport guard still hadn't returned to his chair. The exit was completely unguarded. A terrorist could have entered the airport through this exit. About five minutes later, the guard finally returned. He sat down in his chair. He yawned. A woman had seen the tall man duck under the rope. "I saw a man duck under a security rope," she told an airport supervisor. He started a search for the man. But the man had left the airport. The supervisor asked to see a security videotape. But no one had turned on the videotape machine. Thousands of passengers had to go through a security check again. They were angry. News reporters blamed the tall man. They said it was all his fault. They said he should go to jail. The reporters did not blame the guard.  </p>
