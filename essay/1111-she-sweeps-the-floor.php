				<h1>She Sweeps the Floor</h1>
				<p>  She looks at the floor. There is hair on the floor. There are peanut shells on the floor. There are pennies on the floor. There are paper clips on the floor. She has a dirty floor. She grabs a broom. She grabs a dustpan. She sweeps the floor clean. She sweeps everything into the dustpan.  </p>
