				<h1>She Shoots, She Scores</h1>
				<p>  She plays basketball. The game is intense. She stares at her teammate. Her teammate passes the ball to her. She runs to her team's side  of the court. She dunks the ball in the basket. Her team is happy. They hug her. They shout her name. The people in the bleachers shout, "Hooray!"  </p>
