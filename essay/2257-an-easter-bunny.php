				<h1>An Easter Bunny</h1>
				<p>There was a little train for the children outside in the garden. After he took the pictures, he decided to go on the train and ride it with the children. The children were asking him if he was the real Easter Bunny, and if he had been to Disneyland, Gabriel nodded his head. After he got off the train, he walked around the restaurant and started dancing in the restaurant. People started to applaud as they ate. It was the first time Gabriel ever dressed up as the Easter Bunny, but he loved every second of it.</p>
