				<h1><b> 44. Ed Lost his Dog </b></h1>
				<p>  Ed was sad. He lost his dog. His dog was his best friend. He had his dog since he was 12 years old. His dog's name was Julia. That was Ed's mom's name. Ed decided to put posters all around his town. The poster had a picture of Julia. The poster also had Ed's contact information. Julia was a big, black dog, which weighed about 60 pounds. She had pointed ears and a long tail. Ed was offering a $200 reward to whoever found it. Julia was a friendly dog. She was smart, too. Maybe she could find her way home. Ed hoped she would be okay.  </p>
