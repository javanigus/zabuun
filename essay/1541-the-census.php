				<p>  He turned to page two. He filled in the boxes for his wife. He marked an X in the correct boxes for his wife. Where do I sign my name, he wondered. He looked at every page. There was no blank space to sign his name. He was done. That was easy, he thought. He folded the questionnaire. He put it into the big envelope. He sealed the envelope. The envelope said, "Postage will be paid by U.S. Census Bureau." Liars, he thought. Another example of government lies. Who pays the workers at the U.S. Census Bureau? We do, he thought.
