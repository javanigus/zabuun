				<h1>The Parade</h1>
				<p>A public relations worker for <b>Los Angeles Kings</b> issued a statement for the hockey organization saying that they do not condone people to drink before going to attend the parade. He went on to say that they took the precaution of having the parade start earlier than it did in 2012 so that people didn't have a chance to go get a drink. It seems as if it still failed.</p>
