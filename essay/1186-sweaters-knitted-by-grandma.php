				<h1><b> 37. Sweaters Knitted by Grandma </b></h1>
				<p>  Linda loves her grandma. Her grandma loves her, too. Her grandma knits her a lot of clothes. Linda does not usually like them. They are too old-fashioned. Linda pretends she likes the clothes. She smiles and thanks her grandma. One day, her grandma gave Linda a pink sweater. "I want you to wear this to the dance," her grandma said. Linda was upset inside. "Oh, okay. Will you be there?" Linda asked. "No, but take a picture of yourself for me," her grandma said. Linda nodded. Linda planned to take the picture. Afterwards, she was going to take off the sweater.  </p>
