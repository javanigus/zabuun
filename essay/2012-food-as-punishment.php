				<h1>Food as Punishment</h1>
				<p> "What are they complaining about? I wish I could have had nutraloaf when I was growing up," said Bob Hope, a prison warden in Arkansas. "It tastes a lot better than the grits and corn bread I ate every day. These guys have a lot of nerve to complain. I've eaten it myself many times—I just pop it into the microwave for a minute, spread a little butter on it, and enjoy. What's their beef? Prisoners are a bunch of whiners. If they want five-star prison food, they should commit their crimes in France."</p>
