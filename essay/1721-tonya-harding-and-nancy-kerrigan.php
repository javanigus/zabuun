				<h1>Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan</h1>
				<p>Harding remained in the American limelight for several years following the incident. Her ex-husband released a wedding sex video of Harding and himself. Some of those images were published by Penthouse Magazine. She competed in a Fox TV network broadcast of Celebrity Boxing in 2002. She went on to try a professional boxing career the following year, but with little success. Kerrigan, on the other hand, fell out of the American culture scene, never to be heard of again.</p>
