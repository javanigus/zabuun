				<h1>Stranded at School (A)</h1>
				<p>After ten minutes of walking she reached the parking structure and found her car. She entered her car and tried to turn it on. The car did not start. She tried turning it on again. The car still didn't start. Maria's worst fear had come to life. She was stranded at school because her car had stopped working. Her only choice was to call Mike and ask him to pick her up. She grabbed her cell phone from her backpack and dialed Mike's number. The phone dialed and Mike answered.</p>
