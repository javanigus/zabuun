				<h1>Fight Your Own Battles</h1>
				<p>  Billy came home from school. He was in the first grade. He was crying. He told his dad that Johnny had pushed him. Johnny had pushed him three times. Billy wanted his dad to go to school with him the next day. He wanted his dad to push Johnny. He wanted his dad to push Johnny three times. That would teach Johnny a good lesson. He would never push Billy again. His dad said Billy must learn to fight his own battles. He must learn to fight them now. He must stand up for himself now. No one else could fight his battles. And he must fight. He must not hide or run. He must push Johnny back himself. He must push Johnny back three times. He must do it the next day. If he ran from Johnny now, he would run from everyone for the rest of his life.  </p>
