				<h1>The Phone Call</h1>
				<p>  The phone rang as he was leaving the apartment. He didn't answer it. It's probably Dave, he thought. His brother Dave had said he would call. He returned home an hour later. He checked his phone for missed calls. There was only the one call. But it wasn't his brother's number. Who could it be, he wondered. He dialed the number. A woman answered. She said, "Hello, Kim, how are you doing?" Kim was his wife's name. Who is this, he wondered. "Who's this?" he asked. "Who's this?" she asked. "You called me." He didn't answer. Now he realized who it was. It was some woman who called his wife occasionally. They had been classmates at school. His wife was polite to her. But his wife didn't like her. She never returned this woman's phone calls. He himself had never met or talked to her. "Sorry, wrong number," he said.  </p>
