				<h1>Mismatched Socks</h1>
				<p>  Karla was getting ready for school. She grabbed a pink sock. She tried to find the other one. It should be easy to find. Pink stands out. Especially amongst white socks. She could not find it though. She checked under her bed. She checked in the washing machine. She checked in the dryer. She checked in the dirty clothes basket. She could not find it anywhere. She asked her mom if she saw her pink sock. "Just wear a white sock and long jeans," her mom said. That was a good idea! It did not matter if her socks matched if no one could see her socks. She took out a white sock. She wore it on her left foot. She was ready for school.   </p>
