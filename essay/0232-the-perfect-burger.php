				<h1>The Perfect Burger</h1>
				<p>  Nick loved burgers. He wanted to find a perfect burger. He tried them everywhere he went. He decided to try 10 different places one day. He did not eat the whole thing. He had a bite of each burger. He ate all types of burgers. His favorite was the cheese burger, but he did not taste any amazing burgers. Then he ate the last one. The last one was perfect. The buns were perfectly cooked. The beef was juicy. The lettuce and tomato were fresh. It even had melted cheese and a special sauce. This was the best burger he had ever had.   </p>
