				<h1>She Goes to Bed</h1>
				<p>  She is in her pajamas. She lies down. She puts her head on the pillow. She moves the pillow around a little bit. It is more comfortable now. The lamp is still on. She turns off the lamp. Her bedroom is dark. She puts her head back on the pillow. She goes to sleep.  </p>
