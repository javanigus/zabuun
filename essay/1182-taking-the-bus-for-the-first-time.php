				<h1><b> 33. Taking the Bus for the First Time </b></h1>
				<p>  Margaret usually drove everywhere. It was too bad that her car was in the repair shop. She had to take the bus to work. She was not very familiar with the bus system. She sat down on the bench at the bus stop. A woman sat next to her. Margaret felt uncomfortable. She stood up. The bus came by. She went inside. It cost one dollar and fifty cents to take the bus. She only had a five-dollar bill. "Do you have change?" Margaret asked. "Miss, is this your first time?" he asked. Margaret did not know that bus drivers would not change money. "Just keep the change," she said, and sat down. It should take 35 minutes to get to work. Thirty-five minutes had passed by. She noticed that the area did not look familiar. She realized that she got on the wrong bus.  </p>
