				<h1>A Night at the Drive-In</h1>
				<p>Those old drive-ins were around for decades, but soon after "Forrest Gump" came out, many of them started closing. They closed because of the new multiplex theaters popping up all over the country. People had a choice of many films to watch at those theaters, and soon the drive-in was gone.  In Los Angeles, there is only one remaining drive-in I know of -- the Vineland. There might be more, but I don't know where. It is sad to see them go, but the memories are still with me</p>
