				<h1>A Housewarming Party</h1>
				<p>Housewarming parties get their name from the fact that a long time ago people would actually bring firewood to a new home as a gift. This was so that the person could keep their home warm for the winter. Now most homes have central heating and don't use fires to keep warm.</p>
