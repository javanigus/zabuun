				<p> He called Henry the handyman. Henry was a really nice guy. His rates were much cheaper than a regular plumber's rates. Henry said he'd be over the next day. The next day, Henry arrived only 30 minutes late, which was "on time" for Henry. He tried to turn off the toilet tank shutoff valve on the bathroom wall, but the valve was "frozen." "We don't want to mess with that," he told Stanley. "That valve is too easy to bust, and it would take a lot of work to put a new one on." </p>
