				<h1>Thieves Take Paintings</h1>
				<p>  The thieves used a ladder, a flashlight, and a knife. And they were lucky. They broke into a famous museum. All they had to do was to break a window. They left half an hour later. They left with five paintings worth $200 million. The thieves cut the paintings out of their frames. "They knew what they were doing," said a museum spokesman. But how did they do it so easily? Where was security? Where was the alarm? Where was the camera? One security guard was stationed in that part of the museum. He was asleep during the robbery. He was fired. The security alarm was broken. The museum was waiting for a replacement part. The thieves wore ski masks. The police are studying the videotape for clues to identify the two thieves. The broken window had no steel bars because it was on a busy street, said the spokesman.  </p>
