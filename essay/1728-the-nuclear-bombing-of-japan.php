				<h1>The Nuclear Bombing of Japan</h1>
				<p>On August 15, after the two atomic bomb attacks, and a declaration of war on Japan by the Soviet Union, Japan decided to surrender. The reasoning behind the decision to use nuclear weapons on Japan is debated to this date. Many say that the bombs saved Japanese, and American lives. The argument is that because of Japanese determination, many more lives would have been lost. In any event, the two attacks are the only nuclear attacks in world history.</p>
