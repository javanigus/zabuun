				<h1>Moving to Arizona</h1>
				<p>Jerry knocked on the doors of friends' houses to say one final goodbye. "Good bye, Tom," Jerry told his best friend. "Goodbye Jane," Jerry told his girlfriend. The night fell when Jerry finally finished bidding his farewells to everybody he knew. "Goodbye, Riverdale," Jerry said, looking out his bedroom window as he went to sleep. That night, Jerry dreamed of moving to Arizona and making friends on the first day there. Everything in Arizona seemed great in his dream. The following morning when he awoke, Jerry no longer felt so bad about moving. "Everything is going to be all right," Jerry said to himself as he stepped into the moving van on his way to Arizona.</p>
