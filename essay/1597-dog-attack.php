				<h1>Dog Attack (1)</h1>
				<p>  They were at the north end of Central Park. It was a hot afternoon. They were walking near a small lake. Some people were fishing. James saw a brown pit bull. He hated pit bulls. They were dangerous dogs. They could turn on anyone, even their owner, in a second. The dog was running loose. He couldn't believe it. Dogs in Central Park are supposed to be leashed. James grabbed Rhonda's hand. He didn't say anything about the dog. He watched it carefully as they walked past it. Then James saw the owner of the dog. He was a big fat man wearing shorts and no shirt. He was eating a sandwich. Three pit bulls were leashed to a railing next to him. The man did not seem to know or care that one of his dogs was running around. He was enjoying his sandwich. They walked by the man.  </p>
