				<h1><b> 31. Scared to Ask Questions </b></h1>
				<p>  Mr. Cheng was giving a lecture in his biology class. Daniel had some questions. He wanted to raise his hand, but he was too shy. He did not want his classmates to stare at him. Also, he did not want them to think he was dumb. He also did not want his teacher to think he was dumb, either. However, the test was coming soon. There were questions he had to ask. He got those questions wrong on the previous test. Finally he raised his hand and asked his questions. "Did you not understand these concepts during my lecture?" Mr. Cheng asked. Daniel shook his head. "There is no such thing as a dumb question," Mr. Cheng said.  </p>
