				<h1>The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum</h1>
				<p>The stadium is home to the University of Southern California Trojan football team, which is one of the most historic college teams in the history of the sport. It also was the home field of the UCLA Bruin football team for a number of years. In 1984, the city of Los Angeles and the Coliseum played host to the XXIII Olympic Games, becoming the only stadium to hold that honor. The stadium has played host to World Cup games, boxing matches, and countless concerts, and outdoor events. It is an American tradition that lives on today.</p>
