				<h1>The Los Angeles County Fair</h1>
				<p>Of course, the main attraction the fair has to offer is the food. Here people can enjoy food that is only offered at the fair. One favorite is the chocolate covered bacon treat. It is a place for those with hearty appetites. Almost any food that can be deep-fried can be found at the L.A. County Fair.</p>
