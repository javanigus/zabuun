				<h1>Mother-in-Law (A)</h1>
				<p>Mike grabbed the vacuum and took it to the living room. He connected the vacuum to a power outlet, and began vacuuming the living room carpet. Meanwhile, Maria went into the kitchen to wash the dishes and sweep the floor. There were a lot of dishes in the sink. Fortunately, Maria was a fast dish washer. Mike finished cleaning the living room, and went inside the kitchen to help. The two finished in less than ten minutes. All that was left to clean was the bathroom. Suddenly there was a knock on the door. It was Janet. Mike told Maria to go clean the restroom while he answered the door. Mike opened the front door and cracked a wide smile.</p>
