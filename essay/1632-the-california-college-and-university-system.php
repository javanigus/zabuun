				<h1>The California College and University System</h1>
				<p>California is also home to a large number of privately owned and operated schools. These schools have no ties to the state school system, but some do accept transfer students from community colleges. The most notable and prestigious schools in the state are Stanford University, in Palo Alto, and the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles.</p>
