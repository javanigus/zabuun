				<h1>Packing carefully</h1>
				<p>  Abby was going on a trip to Las Vegas. She was going to stay there for three nights. She had to pack carefully. She first needed a suitcase. All of hers were broken. She borrowed one from her friend. She put in what was really important first. She put in her toothpaste, toothbrush, and wallet inside. She put in thin shirts and shorts. It was going to be hot in Las Vegas. Since it was hot, she brought sunscreen. Abby's skin gets red easily. Her skin also dries up fast. She put lotion in her luggage. She only got through one-fourth of her packing list. This was going to take a while.   </p>
