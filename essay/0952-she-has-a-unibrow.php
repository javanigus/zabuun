				<h1>She Has a Unibrow</h1>
				<p> Heather told Joe what happened. Joe was mad that Heather had to even think about it. "You have been friends with Marissa forever," Joe said. Heather thought about it. She thought about all the times she and Marissa did homework together, ate together, and laughed together. It wasn't worth it to give all that up for popularity. She called Amy. "I'm never leaving Marissa, she's beautiful on the inside." After talking to Amy, Heather asked Marissa and Joe to hang out.</p>
