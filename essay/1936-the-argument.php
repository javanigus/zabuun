				<h1>The Argument (2)</h1>
				<p> "Tomorrow!" " she yelled over the phone. She was furious. Did he have any idea what a difficult day she had had, trying to finish all her realty work so that she would be ready by 7 p.m."  And then he had the nerve to call her up at 6:55 to tell her to forget it. Forget it?! Had he thought about calling her up earlier? Had he thought about asking her for her opinion before deciding everything on his own? "Of course not!" she said as she answered her own question. This was just one more example, she raged on, of how he had absolutely no respect for her, and she was tired of it. "We're through!" she shouted just before hanging up. </p>
