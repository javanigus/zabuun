				<h1>Stop and Frisk</h1>
				<p>As Frank was being searched, he asked the police officers why he was being searched. They ignored him and asked him questions. "Do you have anything illegal on you? Have you been arrested before? Do you have a weapon?" Frank answered "no," to all of their questions. They put Frank in the back of the police car. Frank asked again, why he was being searched. One officer said, "Because you are walking around the neighborhood with a hooded sweatshirt." Frank had done nothing wrong, so the police let him go after searching his backpack.</p>
