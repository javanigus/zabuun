				<h1>Killing an Ant</h1>
				<p>  You cannot kill a person. That is against the law. You will go to jail. You cannot kill someone else's dog. That is against the law, too. You can kill an ant. No one likes ants. Ants eat your food. Ants invade your house. Killing ants is not against the law.  </p>
