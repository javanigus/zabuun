				<h1>The Christmas Gift (1)</h1>
				<p> Hugo asked Kayleen to give him a kiss. "No," she said. He asked her if she knew what day it was. Of course, she replied; it was Christmas day. No, he told her, it was actually "Kissmas" day—that's why she should kiss him. She laughed, and gave him a big kiss. She went back into the kitchen to continue with her dinner preparation. He turned on the bedroom TV and hoped that there was something interesting to watch; five minutes later, his nose was in a book.</p>
