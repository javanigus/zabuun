				<h1>City Welcomes New Store and Its Owners</h1>
				<p> The store will be open from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays. "We think those are hours that our customers will find very convenient. Plus, the three days off gives us a chance to go into the woods and find more critters. We never buy our animals; we always try to collect them from the wild. That way we can pass on huge savings to our customers. And, of course, by removing these animals from their natural habitat, we protect them from being devoured by their natural enemies. So our customers are happy, our animals are happy, and we're happy. It's a win-win for all of us." </p>
