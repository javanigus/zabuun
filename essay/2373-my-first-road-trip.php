				<h1>My first Road Trip</h1>
				<p>George took over the wheel after we left California. He was talking to Nancy the whole time. When we got near the Grand Canyon, Nancy started talking about how she always wanted to go see it. That was when George said those seven words I hated the most, "What my baby wants, my baby gets." He started going down a road that led to the Grand Canyon without even asking me. I started to get really annoyed, but decided not to say anything. It was really late, but they didn't care. It turned out the road that led to the Grand Canyon closed after a certain time. Nancy felt embarrassed, and George started apologizing to me. After we got back on the highway, I drove all the way to Chicago. George knew that I was bugged, so he tried to keep me company. He even told Nancy to sit in the back, which she did. It was a horrible drive. I couldn't believe I had to drive all the way back to Los Angeles with them.</p>
