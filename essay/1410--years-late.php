				<h1>30 Years Late</h1>
				<p>  She found a book in her basement. It was an old book. She opened the book. It was a library book. It was an old library book. The library card was inside the front cover. The due date was on the library card. She looked at the due date. The due date was 30 years ago! Oh my goodness, she thought. I wonder how much money that is, she thought. I wonder how much money I owe. She didn't know what to do. She thought about it. I can just throw the book out, she thought. No one will know. No one will know if I just throw the book out. She threw the book out. She threw the book into the trash can. She thought about it. She felt bad. I shouldn't throw a book into the trash can, she thought. She took it out of the trash can.  </p>
