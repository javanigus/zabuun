				<h1>Buying a Backpack</h1>
				<p>  Howard goes to a backpack store. He likes the red backpack. He looks at the tag. The backpack is $40! He asks the cashier if he can lower the price. "I will sell it you for $39." Howard shakes his head. "How about $30, and I tell my friends to come here?" The cashier agrees to the deal.  </p>
