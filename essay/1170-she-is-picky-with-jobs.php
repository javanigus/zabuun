				<h1><b> 21. She is Picky with Jobs </b></h1>
				<p>  Sophia needs some money. She knows she should get a job, but she is picky with jobs. She wants a job that pays a lot. She wants a job that gives her power. She wants a job that has good health insurance. She does not have a college degree. She can only do so much. The most she can get is $15 an hour. That is only if she is lucky. She does not want to work at a restaurant. She does not like the idea of obeying people's orders. She does not want to work at an office. That is boring. People tell her that she can't be picky if she doesn't have a degree.  </p>
