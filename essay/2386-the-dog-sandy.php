				<h1>The Dog Sandy</h1>
				<p>This day was different though. Sandy saw a cat across the street and started running after the cat just as Donna's neighbor was driving home. Sandy was hit and killed by the speeding car as Donna screamed in shock. "No!" yelled Donna, but it was too late. Sandy was gone. Donna was very sad. She blamed herself for Sandy's tragic death, but her mom told her that Sandy was happy in Heaven now. Donna held a little service for her doggie and buried her in the back yard so that Sandy would always be near her. Donna knew they would be together again.</p>
