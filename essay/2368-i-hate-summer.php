				<h1>I Hate Summer</h1>
				<p>"You know, Carol and I were about to leave. You guys want to come with us?" Susan asked the boys. "Sure, where to?" Paul asked. Susan said that they were going to the park, because she liked to see all the people having fun there. "Awesome, I love going to the park during the summer," Paul said. He looked at Mark and whispered, "Shut up, don't say anything." They all left, and Mark looked like he was going to cry. "I hate summer," Mark said to himself.</p>
