				<h1>Late to School</h1>
				<p> The bell rang. She was not at school. She was still at home. She was in bed sleeping. She stayed up late with her friends last night. They watched movies. Her school called her parents: "Your child did not go to school." Mom was surprised. She was upset. She was at work. She went back home. She slammed through the door. "Wake up!" she yelled at her daughter. "You are late to school," mom said. She got up from bed. She changed quickly. She was scared of her mom. She knew she was serious. Mom did not fool around. She drove her to school. "Do not be late to school again," Mom said. "Okay, mom," she said. She was still sleepy. </p>
