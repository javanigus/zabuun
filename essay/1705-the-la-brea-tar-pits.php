				<h1>The La Brea Tar Pits</h1>
				<p>The museum is a major attraction to visitors to L.A., and is a primary science attraction for schools, clubs and other organizations interested in the past. It is a piece of living history that is in a constant state of change because of new discoveries. It is a good place to spend a leisurely afternoon in the City of Angels, which is open all year round.</p>
