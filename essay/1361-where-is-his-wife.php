				<h1>Where Is His Wife? (1)</h1>
				<p>  It was late. His wife wasn't home yet. He was worried. She was a real estate agent. She showed apartments to clients. She showed apartments day after day. She showed apartments all over the city. She showed apartments in uptown Manhattan. She showed apartments in midtown Manhattan. She showed apartments in downtown Manhattan. Meet a client at a building. Look at one or two apartments in that building. Walk to another building. Look at one or two apartments in that building. Walk to one building after another. Look at one apartment after another. Take the elevator. Take the stairs. Take the subway sometimes. Take the bus sometimes. She always called him if she was going to come home late. He called her cell phone. She said hello. He said hello. But she didn't reply. He heard nothing. He said hello again. There was no answer. The connection was dead.  </p>
