				<h1>Julie Joins Facebook</h1>
				<p>The next morning, Julie woke up and enthusiastically logged into Facebook in hopes that she would have one or two new friends. She could not believe her eyes. Her inbox was full of friend requests from dozens and dozens of young handsome men that were complimenting her beauty and wanted to know all about her. Julie decided to accept only the best-looking ones and began chatting with them day and night, never letting them know that they were actually talking to a grandma. The next time Julie met up with Mary, she thanked her so much for the phone and remarked, "I haven't felt so young and pretty in years!" Mary was confused and asked, "Why?" Julie just gave a mischievous smile and changed the topic.</p>
