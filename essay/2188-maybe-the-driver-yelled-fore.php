				<h1>Maybe the Driver Yelled "Fore!"</h1>
				<p> The police found the driver a day later. They charged him with various offenses. Later, the driver went to court. He told the judge he had had a flat tire. The judge made him pay a small fine. Jerry couldn't believe it when he heard the news from a police officer. Jerry said, "That guy didn't have a flat tire. He was speeding! He was drunk on whisky and high on pot. He totaled two cars. If I had been in my car, I'd be dead. He left the scene of the crash. He ran from the police. He had no insurance. He lied to the judge. And nothing happens to him?!" The officer said, "Yeah, some people have all the luck. On the other hand, if you had been in your car and he had killed you, he probably would be in jail right now. So, which do you prefer?" </p>
