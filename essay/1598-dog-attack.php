				<h1>Dog Attack (2)</h1>
				<p>  James didn't say anything to the man about his dog. They walked another 100 feet. They heard a scream. They turned around. The pit bull was pulling on a little girl's foot. The girl was lying on a blanket. The dog was trying to drag her off the blanket. Her father yelled at the dog. The owner yelled at the dog. The dog ran to the owner. The little girl was bawling. Her father picked her up and held her in his arms. They should throw all pit bulls into the ocean, James thought. They walked into a park building. James told an employee inside about the attack. "Really?" he said. "That's too bad. I hope she's all right." He didn't say anything about calling the park police. They walked back outside. The little girl was still bawling in her father's arms. The pit bull was now on a leash.  </p>
