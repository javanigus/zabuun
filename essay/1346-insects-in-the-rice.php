				<h1>Insects in the Rice</h1>
				<p>   "Look at this," she said. He looked. He looked inside a plastic bag. There was rice inside the bag. But something else was inside the bag. "What are these things?" he asked. They were insects. The insects were crawling around. A lot of insects were crawling around. "That's disgusting," he said. "Where did they come from?" She said, "They came from you!" He denied it. He didn't have insects. Not even one. "You bought the wrong bag of rice," she said. "I told you which bag of rice to buy. But you wanted to save money. And I agreed to it. Never again. From now on, we buy the same brand I've always bought." He agreed. She tied up the bag. She put the bag inside a fresh plastic bag. She tied up the second plastic bag. "This is for you," she said. "Gee, thanks," he said.  </p>
