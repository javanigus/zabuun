				<h1>Another Day in the Life of Mike (A)</h1>
				<p>Driving around beautiful, sunny Pasadena, Mike headed to his local grocery store. Mike parked his car under a shady tree. He got off the car and locked it. As Mike walked into the store, he felt a blast of air from the air conditioner above his head. He first picked up a shopping basket from the entrance, and walked to the cold food aisle to grab a dozen white eggs. Next, Mike grabbed a loaf of sliced bread for toast. Finally, he grabbed a gallon of cold milk. With all the items in his basket, he stood in line to pay. As he approached the cashier, Mike gently placed the carton of eggs and bread down as well as placing down the gallon of milk on the counter. He took out his wallet to get ready to pay. The cashier was a young lady who looked like a high school student. She finished helping the last customer.</p>
