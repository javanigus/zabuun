				<h1>Ursula Burns: From Poverty to the Fortune 500</h1>
				<p>Burns first worked at Xerox Corporation as a summer intern in 1980. Through the years, she has worked her way up the corporate ladder to become the company's Chair, and Chief Executive Officer. She became CEO in 2009, and during her tenure she transformed the company from a primarily copy paper, and copy machine company, to a well-rounded, full-service company. It has, not only survived, but thrived in a world that is quickly becoming paperless. She has been listed by Forbes several times as one of the most powerful women in the world, ranking No. 22 in 2014.</p>
