				<h1>Celebrating a Win</h1>
				<p>When Mexico played again the following week, police patrolled the streets in advance. This time they were going to be prepared if Mexico won again. Mexico was playing against the Netherlands. The Dutch team won 2-1. Mexican fans in Huntington Park still took to the streets despite the loss. This time the police were waiting in riot gear. The fans waved flags, chanted, honked horns, rocked cars and even lit firecrackers but no one threw bottles. The police didn't arrest anyone. They did have to close off three blocks to traffic, though. The police were probably secretly glad that Mexico didn't win.  In four years, when the next World Cup happens, they'll worry about it again.</p>
