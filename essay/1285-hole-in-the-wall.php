He wanted to repair the hole. He went to Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart has everything for sale. Wal-Mart is a very popular store. He asked a clerk, "How can I fix a nail hole in my bathroom wall?" The clerk said it was very simple. A nail hole was easy to fix. "Just buy this tube of Nail Hole Filler. Then squeeze it into the hole," the clerk said. He took the filler home.
