				<h1>Come over anytime, but not really</h1>
				<p>Patricia followed the directions, and at 9:00 a.m., she rang the doorbell at 2374 Evergreen Avenue. It took Helen awhile to answer the door. She looked genuinely surprised, but also confused when she saw Patricia on her doorstep. "What are you doing here? How did you get my address?" Helen asked. She was still in her pajamas and her hair was a mess. "You told me to drop by anytime we both had a day off, so I got your address from our manager. I want to give you a surprise!" Patricia said. "I was just being polite. You can't just show up at someone's house!" Helen said before slamming the door on Patricia's face.</p>
