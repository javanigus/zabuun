She was getting dressed. She was afraid that people across the street could see into the apartment. He told her that nobody was interested in seeing her get dressed. She said there were a lot of weirdos in New York City. Who knew what kind of weirdos lived across the street? He looked out the window. "Wow, you're right," he said.

He asked, "What now?" She said one blind wasn't fully closed. "Someone can still see me," she said.  </p>
