				<h1>A Wedding</h1>
				<p>  "Tomorrow will be the best day of my life," Betty said. "Yes, it will be," said her mom. "I'm so happy for you. Paul is such a good man. He will make a great husband and father. And he's so nice. Your dad and I both love him." Betty met Paul after she broke her leg. She broke her leg skiing. Paul was the doctor who fixed her leg. He visited her every day in the hospital. Then he visited her at home. He brought her Get Well cards and gifts. They fell in love with each other. "I never thought a broken leg would be a good thing," Betty told her mom.  "But it was the best thing that ever happened to you. Life is strange sometimes," her mom said. After Betty's leg healed, she and Paul started dating. They went to movies and restaurants. They went to the beach. They even went skiing. They were so happy together. One day Paul asked Betty to marry him. "Can we have lots of kids?" she asked. "Of course," he said. "But let ME teach them how to ski." They both laughed.  </p>
