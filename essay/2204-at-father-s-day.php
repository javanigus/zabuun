				<h1>At Father's Day</h1>
				<p>When Tim unwrapped the box, he laughed. Inside the box was the Father's Day card Isaac made in school. Also inside the box were a dress shirt and a tie. They were the same color as the card Isaac made. Tim, Francesca, and Isaac went next door to Genny's house for a barbecue. Tim wore the dress shirt and tie.</p>
