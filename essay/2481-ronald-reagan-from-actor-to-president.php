				<h1>Ronald Reagan: From Actor to President</h1>
				<p>Reagan served as Governor of California for four years prior to becoming president. His presidential term was very successful as he presided over many of the landmark events during the 1980s. During his final term, Reagan suffered from the effects of Alzheimer's Disease, which negatively affected his ability to govern, but he carried out his term, and his legacy as a great president remained intact.</p>
