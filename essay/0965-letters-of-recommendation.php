				<h1>Letters of Recommendation</h1>
				<p> Claire asked her swim coach to write her a letter of recommendation. Her swim coach knew her well. The problem was that the swim coach wasn't the best writer. He did not go to college. Claire asked him to write a letter anyways. "Of course I'll write you a letter, I'll even send it to you," he said. One week later, Claire got an email for her swim coach. She was nervous to read what he wrote. Claire was impressed with the letter. Her swim coach was really funny yet intelligent in the letter!</p>
