				<h1>Hello Dolly!</h1>
				<p>"You bet, boss!" I responded. That was how I got put in charge of the lighting for one of the best plays ever written. Even though this was just a high school production, we played to packed houses almost every night we were on. I did such a great job that when the theater department decided to put on "West Side Story" the next semester, they asked me if I wanted to join the team. It was such an honor to be selected, so of course my answer was yes!</p>
