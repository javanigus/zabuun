				<h1>The Dead Pedestrian</h1>
				<p> The police found the bus parked a few blocks from the accident scene. The driver was gone. He had been transporting people to the annual Earth Day festival in Koreatown. About 30,000 people usually attend this event. A police spokesman said that the driver would be charged with murder. "If we could charge him with 'destroying a happy family,' we'd do that, too," the spokesman said. </p>
