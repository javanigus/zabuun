				<h1>Man Flies 200 Miles in Lawn Chair (2)</h1>
				<p> Bo got up to 15,000 feet, where the air is thin. His heavy coat kept him warm. The wind carried him eastward at an average speed of 22 mph. He flew over the Cascade Range. When he got near the Ochoco Mountains, he started shooting the balloons. He made a soft landing near Paulina, about 200 miles east of Roseburg. Duke was waiting for him. When Bo got home late that night, he tried to tell his wife all about his journey.  Still angry, she refused to listen to his story. She couldn't believe that her husband could be so stupid. She told Bo to sleep on the sofa. The next day, he told his son about his interesting adventure. His son went to school and bragged about his dad to all of his schoolmates. Nobody believed him. </p>
