				<h1>It's a Boy!</h1>
				<p>  Sasha was pregnant with her second child. She and her husband knew it was a boy. Their first child was a girl. Pauline was four years old. She was excited about her new baby brother. She was going to help feed him. She was going to help dress him. She was going to help bathe him. "I'll teach him how to talk," she said. "I'll teach him how to walk. I'll teach him how to read my books." Sasha went to the hospital. She gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Then she got sick. It was an infection. Her body was attacking itself. The doctors had to act fast. They amputated her legs. Then they amputated her arms. They saved her life. She was grateful. She had her husband. She had her daughter. She had her new son. "I'm alive," she said. "I'm so happy just to be alive!"  </p>
