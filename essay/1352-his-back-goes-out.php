				<h1>His Back Goes Out</h1>
				<p>  They were sitting on the sofa. He started to get up. "Oh," he groaned. "What's the matter?" his wife asked. He was standing still. He wasn't moving. He was bent over. He wasn't standing straight up. "Is it your back again?" his wife asked. "Yes, it's my back again," he said. He couldn't move. "Can I help?" she asked. He shook his head. All he could do was wait. A minute later, he put one foot forward. Then another foot. He slowly walked to the bathroom. He still wasn't standing up straight. He was still bent over. He went into the bathroom. Then he slowly returned to the living room. He slowly sat back down on the sofa. "I told you not to carry that suitcase up those subway stairs!" his wife yelled. "But you didn't listen to me. You never listen to me. Next time, I carry the suitcase."  </p>
