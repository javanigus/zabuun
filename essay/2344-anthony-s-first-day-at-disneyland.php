				<h1>Anthony's First Day at Disneyland</h1>
				<p>The best part of the theme park is the rides. "Can we go on the Captain Nemo Ride?" That question was soon followed by "Can we go on the Matterhorn?" Soon Anthony had gone on just about every ride. He was overwhelmed by the place. Soon the family was back in their SUV heading back home with Anthony fast asleep. It was the greatest day of his young life. A day he would later call "the best day of my life."</p>
