				<h1>A Teddy Bear</h1>
				<p>As Sally's mom was clearing the dining-room table, she heard a knock at the door. She opened it, and saw Johnny's mom standing at the doorstep with the old worn-out bear. She started jumping with joy and thanked Johnny's mom. Sally's mom walked slowly into Sally's room, raised up Sally's blanket, and placed the bear under Sally's arms. She then turned around to Sally's desk looking at the picture of Sally's dad giving her the bear as he left to the army. She smiled and kissed Sally on the forehead, then gave one to the bear as well.</p>
