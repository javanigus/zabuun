				<h1>Add Numbers</h1>
				<p>  Maria was learning to add numbers. She liked to add numbers. It was easy to add numbers. She could add one and one. She knew that one and one are two. She knew that two and two are four. She knew that three and three are six. But that was it. She didn't know what four and four are. She asked her mom. Her mom told her that four and four are eight. "Oh, now I know," Maria said. "I am four years old now. In four more years, I will be eight." Maria was a fast learner. She wasn't a slow learner.  </p>
