				<h1>A Hood in a Hoody</h1>
				<p>  The man walked into a bank. He wore a hoody. He wore gloves. It was summertime. It was hot outside. No one else was wearing a hoody. No one else was wearing gloves. The bank guard looked at the man. "Why are you wearing a hoody?" the bank guard asked. "Why are you wearing gloves?" The man said he had a disease. He had a contagious disease. He coughed. He coughed again. The bank guard backed away. He did not want to get a disease. He stopped watching the man. He watched other people enter the bank. He forgot about the man with the contagious disease. A few minutes later, the man ran out of the bank. He was carrying a money bag.  </p>
