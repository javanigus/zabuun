				<h1>Jury Service in California</h1>
				<p> You will not get paid very much for your service--$15 a day. Also, the state will reimburse you 34 cents for each mile that you drive in your car (one way only). Some employers will pay your salary while you serve; some won't. If you own a business, you might be away from it for one to four weeks, occasionally even longer. You could lose a lot of money if you do most of the work for your business. But the judge won't excuse you unless you can demonstrate extreme financial hardship. Parking for jurors is always free. </p>
