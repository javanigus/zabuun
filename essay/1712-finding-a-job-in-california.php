				<h1>Finding a Job in California</h1>
				<p>Internships are another way for people to gain employment. Interns are not paid for their work, or are paid very little. The purpose of an internship is for the company to see first-hand how a person works before hiring them. By using this method, employers gain insight into the workers' character and work ethic. Interns gain valuable experience they can use for future jobs.</p>
