				<h1>The New "No Parking" Sign</h1>
				<p>  It was noon on Wednesday. "That's not fair. That's not right," Mel told Irene. He parked his car every night. He parked his car on the street. "Look. The pole is in fresh cement," he said. "The cement is still wet." It was a new parking sign. It said, "No Parking 9:30AM-11AM Wednesday." The old parking sign was different. The old sign had said, "No Parking 1PM-2:30PM Wednesday." "My neighbors and I park on this street," said Mel. "We know that we can't park here from 1:00 to 2:30 p.m. But early this morning they changed the sign. Did they warn us? Did they say anything to us? No, but they told parking enforcement! Parking enforcement wrote 25 tickets this morning! Twenty-five tickets! I counted them! Each ticket is $48. We were all going to move our cars before 1:00. Now it's too late. Why didn't they warn us?"  </p>
