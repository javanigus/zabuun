				<h1>Celebration (A)</h1>
				<p>"Let's go inside. I have surprise for you," Mike said, remembering the flowers he had ordered to be delivered inside the apartment. "I'm sorry Mike. I'm just tired from standing for four hours," Maria said as they walked to the front door of the apartment. "There is no need to explain, honey. I totally understand," he said, feeling excited for the surprise that awaited Maria on the other side of the door he was opening. With his key he unlocked the door letting Maria enter first. Her surprise was worth the deed.</p>
