				<h1>A Project for Science Fair</h1>
				<p>  The fifth graders at Kennedy School had a science fair. They had to work in teams of three. Each group had to come up with a project. They were to make a display. They had one month to work on their projects. The best project would get a medal and ribbons. On the day of the science fair, everyone brought their projects. There were simple ones. There were complicated ones. Some people studied plants and animals. Some looked into electricity and magnetism. Some even did projects on bacteria and viruses. All the projects were good. It made picking the winner very difficult.   </p>
