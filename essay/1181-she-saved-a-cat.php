				<h1><b> 32. She Saved a Cat </b></h1>
				<p>  Kim was an average girl. She was not that pretty or ugly. She was decent-looking. She was not very smart, nor very dumb. She was neither mean nor nice. She was always in between. Something happened though. She was walking home from work one day. She heard a "meow" sound. Where was it coming from? It was coming from a tree! A cat was stuck. Kim climbed up the tree. "Here, kitty, kitty," she said. She carried the cat down. The owner thanked her and gave her $500. Kim was on the news. Everyone in her town knew her. People even asked for her autograph.  </p>
