				<h1>Leaving a Tip</h1>
				<p>Sharon knew that Ken wasn't born in the United States and wondered if that had something to do with how Ken felt. "Well, in the United States, tipping is kind of expected. Servers generally aren't paid that well and rely on tips to feed their families. The exception of course is if the service was really bad, but I had a lovely time. Didn't you?" Sharon asked. "Service was great," Ken agreed, "but why don't they just pay the servers better so we don't have to pay more?" Sharon agreed with Ken, but she still left a 20 percent tip.</p>
