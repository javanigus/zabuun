				<h1>Michael Moore: Exposing the Truth</h1>
				<p>He followed this film with a string of documentaries that touched on many of the social and political problems Americans face daily. His film "Fahrenheit 9/11," probes the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001. He is not kind to the George W. Bush administration for their lack of response to the attacks, and to the Bush family's alleged ties to Osama Bin Laden, the mastermind of the attack.</p>
