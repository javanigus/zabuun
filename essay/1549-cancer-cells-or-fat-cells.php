				<h1>Cancer Cells or Fat Cells?</h1>
				<p>  Norm woke up to go to the bathroom. He looked in the bathroom mirror. That bump used to be smaller. It was on the side of his nose. The bump looked puffy. He touched it. It wasn't hard. It didn't hurt. It wasn't a different color. Maybe it was just some fat cells. Or, maybe it was skin cancer. His dad had had skin cancer. Doctors had cut out one suspicious spot after spot. They had cut out spots from all over his face. But maybe Norm was just getting a little extra fat in his nose. What's a little extra fat? But what if it was cancer? Cancer would eat that fat off. It would also eat his nose off. Better to have a doctor look at it. Better to pay a little money now than a lot of money later. It's only money. He went back to sleep.  </p>
