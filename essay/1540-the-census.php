				<p>  He opened his mailbox. He looked at the envelope. It was the U.S. census questionnaire. He shook his head. How long would this take, he wondered. He went back to his apartment. He opened the envelope. Another envelope was inside. He unfolded the questionnaire. He read the instructions. What a pleasant surprise, he thought. This looks easy. He only had to answer 17 questions. They were on the first two pages. He picked up a pen. He filled in the boxes for his name. He filled in the boxes for his date of birth. He filled in the boxes for his phone number. He answered the questions. How many people live in your home? Do you own or rent your home? What is your sex? What is your age? Are you Hispanic? What is your race? Do you live somewhere else sometimes? He marked an X in the correct boxes.  </p>
