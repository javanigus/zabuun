				<h1>A Wet Kitchen Floor (2)</h1>
				<p>  The garbage disposal was old. It was leaking water. Eddie needed to replace it. He opened his toolbox. He took a screwdriver out of his toolbox. The garbage disposal had three screws. He unscrewed the three screws. He took the garbage disposal out. He put it on the kitchen floor. He wanted to take it to the store. He wanted to buy a new one at the store. But there was a problem. The garbage disposal was connected to a cable. It was the electric cable. Eddie didn't know much about electricity. He knew that electricity was dangerous. He knew that electricity could kill him. He put the garbage disposal back. He screwed in the three screws. He put tape over the electric switch on the wall. Now he could not turn on the garbage disposal. He called his landlord. He said she needed to replace the garbage disposal.  </p>
