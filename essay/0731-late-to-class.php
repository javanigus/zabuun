				<h1>Late to Class</h1>
				<p> He stood in the hall. He looked around him. There were many doors. He did not know which door was the right door to enter. He was lost at school. It was going to be twelve. He was going to be late. It was his first day of college. His class was in Room 190. He looked at all the doors. They each had a number, but there were no rooms numbered 190. He did not know what to do. He asked a stranger: "Where is Room 190?" The stranger did not know. He asked another stranger. She also did not know. No one knew where Room 190 was. He checked his notebook, where He wrote down his classroom number. It was not Room 190. It was Room 140. Room 190 did not exist. He ran to Room 140. He was one minute late. </p>
