				<h1>The Cyclone in Myanmar</h1>
				<p> "We were in our hotel," said an American tourist who was visiting the capital with his wife. "We could see the weather changing, but the locals didn't seem to be worried. When the wind smashed the windows in our hotel room, we started worrying. The wind blew the rain and tree branches and other debris into our room. We went into the bathroom and got into the tub. We didn't feel safe in the bathroom, but where could we go? The wind howled and things banged around forever. We thought we were going to die for sure. When the storm finally passed, we looked outside. We couldn't believe the destruction. Mostly all we could see was just water." There was no telling when power would be restored or when roads would be usable. The Myanmar government was doing nothing to help matters. "That's because they prefer that we all die,"  said an angry survivor. </p>
