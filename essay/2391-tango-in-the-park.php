				<h1>Tango in the Park</h1>
				<p>On the night of the tango event, Mary wore her high-heeled dancing shoes. There was a wooden dance floor in the middle of the music center plaza. A group of musicians played on a small stage in front of the dance floor. "May I have this dance?" a man asked Mary when she arrived. He wore a sticker with the words "dance instructor" on it. Mary accepted the invitation to dance. That night Mary learned that it did take two to tango.</p>
