				<h1>Cell Phone Saves Him</h1>
				<p>  Herman was 23. He was at a party. He was drinking and having a good time. His friend told him to spend the night. "You shouldn't drive tonight," his friend said. Herman agreed. He would spend the night. But he got into his car and left. He knew the highway. But he missed a curve. His car flew 400 feet in the air. It landed deep in the woods. It was completely hidden from view. Herman's friend called the police the next day. The police searched for four days. "We were able to triangulate his position. His cell phone gave us a signal until the battery died," said a policeman. They found Herman. He was alive. He had eaten plants. He had drunk water from a stream. He had crawled to the nearby stream. A doctor said Herman would survive. He had only one major injury. Both legs were paralyzed.  </p>
