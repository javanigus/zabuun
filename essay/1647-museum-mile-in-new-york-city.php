				<h1>Museum Mile in New York City</h1>
				<p>One block up on 104th Street and Fifth Avenue is El Museo del Barrio. This museum started as a space to reflect the city's large Puerto Rican migrant community. Now it features exhibits focusing on art from all over Latin America. Across the avenue is the Central Park Conservatory Garden, with a fountain that has a sculpture of three dancing life-size women.</p>
