				<h1>Seeing the Entire United States</h1>
				<p>Once in New York City Gustav asked the hotel concierge if they could arrange some trips for him. The concierge was helpful and informed Gustav about the different Amtrak trains he could take to Philadelphia and Washington D.C.  "What about the Grand Canyon and Hollywood?" Gustav asked. "What about them?" the concierge asked, looking confused. "What about trips there?" Gustav asked. The concierge pulled out a map and showed Gustav how far Arizona and California are from New York. "A train there will take you about a week. A plane ride will take about six hours," the concierge explained. Gustav was disappointed. He had no idea that the United States was such a large country. He was determined to see as much as he could though. He wondered how much it would cost to rent a camper and drive it across the U.S.</p>
