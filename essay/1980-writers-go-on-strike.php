				<h1>Writers Go on Strike</h1>
				<p> "Writers are too demanding," complained Reese Majors, vice president of CEC Entertainment, a production company with seven shows airing weekly on network TV. "They think they are so special. All they do is type a bunch of words onto a piece of paper. My six-year-old can do that. They claim that writing is work. But how can it be work when it is done in the comfort of their homes? How can you call sitting at home 'work'? The actors and the crew have to go on location, where they must battle the cold, the heat, the jet lag, and the loneliness of being away from home. No home cooking for them—they have to eat catered meals. But you don't hear them whining for four more cents per DVD!"</p>
