				<h1>Mary, Tom, and Buddy (2)</h1>
				<p>Mary and Tom were about to take their first bites into their burgers when Buddy came in through the door wagging his tail and salivating. "I think he wants a burger," Tom said. Mary rose from her seat and made a burger for Buddy. Buddy ate the burger in one bite as soon as Mary handed it to him.</p>
