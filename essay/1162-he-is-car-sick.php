				<h1><b> 13. He Is Car Sick </b></h1>
				<p>  Andrew is completely fine with riding on an airplane. He does not get sick when the plane takes off. Andrew hates being in a car though. If he is in a car for more than half an hour, he gets sick. He especially hates it when he is in traffic. His body feels sick. He wishes that he wouldn't get car sick so easily. He can't go on fun road trips. His friend invited him to go to Las Vegas last year. Andrew had to say no. He wanted to go, but he would throw up too much.  </p>
