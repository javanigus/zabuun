				<h1>Trouble with the Captain</h1>
				<p> The team captain was the next to make a speech. "Coach is right, you guys all have to keep up. Keep up or go home." First, the team did warm-ups, which included stretching, running, bouncing the ball with their knees, and more. Howard was having trouble, especially with running. After the warm ups, the boys played a game. Howard was already very tired. The captain pulled him aside and said, "I don't know how you made the team. You got lucky." Howard ignored what he said and continued to do the best he could.</p>
