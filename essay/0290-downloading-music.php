				<h1>Downloading Music</h1>
				<p>  Thomas wanted the new Green Day album. He didn't have a lot of money though. He lost his job. He had to pay for college, too. He decided to download it. He searched for it on the Internet. He clicked a link. It was a website filled with a lot of music. He first downloaded the Green Day album. He was amazed with how easy it was. He downloaded more albums. He downloaded a One Direction album and sent it to his sister. His sister loves One Direction. His sister wasn't happy though. His sister was mad that he illegally downloaded music. She told him to buy the albums.   </p>
