				<h1>Maria's New Hobby (A)</h1>
				<p>Maria decided to go to buy a piano soon after. She hopped into her car and drove to the nearest music shop in town, looking forward to making the purchase. She arrived and entered the music shop that was filled with musicians testing out instruments. Maria looked for the piano section. The music shop was quite large, and so Maria had a difficult time finding the right section. An employee by the name of Gus spotted Maria wandering around looking lost. He approached her and tried to help.</p>
