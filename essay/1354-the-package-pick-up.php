				<h1>The Package Pick-Up (2)</h1>
				<p>  He asked the driver to wait. Craig used a knife to open the package. He dug through the packaging materials. He looked for the call tag. There was no call tag. The driver left. Craig stuffed everything back into the box. He sealed the box with tape. He took the box back into the bedroom. He went online. He reread an email from Target. The email said, "We will send the call tag to UPS." He called up UPS. The UPS agent said, "We don't have the call tag yet. It should arrive tomorrow." Craig asked, "Why did the driver come by without the call tag?" The UPS agent said, "I'm sorry. We made a mistake. He probably thought you had the call tag. Sometimes customers have the call tag. A driver can come by again on Thursday. Will someone be there between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m."  </p>
