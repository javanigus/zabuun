				<h1>Forever Single</h1>
				<p>   "No one will ever marry me," said Paula. "Of course someone will marry you," said her sister Joan. Paula said she wasn't pretty. A man wants to marry a pretty woman. "I think you're pretty. Some man will marry you. Look at Mama," said Joan. "Mama is not a pretty woman. Daddy married Mama. So, someone will marry you. Of course someone will marry you." Paula did not think so. She was 30 years old. She was not married. She didn't have a boyfriend. Her last boyfriend was 10 years ago. She didn't go out on dates. No man ever asked her out on a date. "I can't even get a date," she said. "How can I get married if I can't even get a date?" Joan told her to stop worrying. She would find a man when she stopped worrying about finding a man.  </p>
