				<h1>The One Who Stayed Behind</h1>
				<p> In her third year, Darcy took more classes than the average student. It was very stressful. She was in class from 7 a.m.- 6 p.m. She felt like she could not think in any of her classes. She was not getting much sleep. She talked to a guidance counselor, who told her that she should drop two classes. The counselor also said that it was better to get good grades and stay longer in college than to get bad grades and graduate on time. Darcy dropped two classes and had to stay in college for two extra years.</p>
