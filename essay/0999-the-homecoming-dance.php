				<h1>The Homecoming Dance</h1>
				<p> "Give me a second, I'm going to see how Ben is doing," Kyle said to Mary. Kyle walked over to Benjamin. "Hey where's Natasha?" Kyle asked. "She's in the bathroom," Benjamin said. "None of us are happy right now. Why don't we switch dates?" Kyle suggested. "That would leave me and Mary unhappy," Ben said. Kyle sighed. He knew Ben was right.
