				<h1>Chop Down the Trees</h1>
				<p>  "You have to chop down those two trees," said the fire control agent. "Why do I have to chop down those two trees?" asked Diane. "Because those two trees are a fire hazard," said the fire control agent. "All trees are a fire hazard," said Diane. "Yes, but those two trees are a super fire hazard," said the agent. "Why are those two trees a super fire hazard?" Diane asked. "Because those two trees are right next to your house. Chop them down," he said. Diane was poor. She couldn't afford to pay someone to chop the trees down. The agent said, "Chop them down, or I will fine you." The next day, she poured gasoline on both trees. Then she set them on fire.  </p>
