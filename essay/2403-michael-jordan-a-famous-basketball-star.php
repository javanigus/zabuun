				<h1>Michael Jordan: A Famous Basketball Star</h1>
				<p>Chamberlain did win two NBA titles in his career, but no one in the game ever dominated it the way he did. He holds several league records, one of which is that he is the only player ever to score 100 points in a single game. However, when Chamberlain played the game, the NBA was not as big as it was in the 90s. During the 90s, the league enjoyed a much greater popularity among American viewers, and much of this can be attributed to the greatness of Michael Jordan. Jordan brought a style of play that had rarely been seen in the NBA. He garnered many individual awards during his career. He played his last few seasons as a member of the Washington Bullets.</p>
