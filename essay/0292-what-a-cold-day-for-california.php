				<h1>What a cold day for California</h1>
				<p>  Gabby turned on the weather channel. It was going to be 45 degrees Fahrenheit! What a cold day for California! Gabby had to prepare. She found a jacket with fur. She hasn't worn it since December. She put her gloves on her hands. Her grandmother knitted them for her. She put on two layers of pants. She wrapped a scarf around her neck. Her grandmother knitted that for her, too. She put a hat on her head. She put on her fuzzy socks. She put on her boots. She was ready to go. She stepped outside. She saw people wearing shorts and tank tops.   </p>
