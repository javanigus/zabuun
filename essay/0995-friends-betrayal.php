				<h1>Friends Betrayal</h1>
				<p> "Hey guys, I know you want to vote for Benjamin, and I think he's a great guy. The thing is, he would be a terrible captain. He always puts school first. He would rather study for a test than practice his breast strokes. I love swim and would put everything I have into this team."
