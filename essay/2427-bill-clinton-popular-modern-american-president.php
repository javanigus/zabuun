				<h1>Bill Clinton: Popular Modern American President</h1>
				<p>Bill Clinton's presidency was marred by the Monica Lewinsky affair. Lewinski was a White House intern who engaged in sexual activity with the president. Bill Clinton denied any wrongdoing, but his political opponents, the Republicans, pursued Clinton in an effort to damage his reputation and the Democratic Party in general. Republican politicians tried to have Clinton impeached from office and dogged him for years. In the end, Clinton survived the controversy, and completed his successful term as president. Hillary stood by him during the dark times, and the couple remains together to this day.</p>
