				<h1>Outside His Window (1)</h1>
				<p>  He has a big window in his bedroom. His desk is in his bedroom. His desk is next to the big window. He sits at his desk. He looks east. He looks east toward the East River. The East River is about six blocks away. But he cannot see the East River. Buildings block his view. Buildings in New York City are like trees in a forest. They are everywhere. They are beautiful. They are all different. He can see about 13 different buildings. The farthest building is almost three blocks away. Most of the buildings are about 12 stories tall.  Most of them are light brown or dirty white. But the tallest one is completely red. White smoke comes out of its top. It has no windows on its west side. The west wall is red bricks. Maybe red bricks are cheaper than glass windows. Maybe it's a prison.  </p>
