				<p>The police gave him a few tests to see if he had been drinking, and Anthony failed them. The police took him away. His father picked him up and they went to talk to a lawyer. The lawyer said that Anthony would have to take alcohol education classes, go to Alcoholics Anonymous, do community service, and pay a fine. Anthony's father said that Anthony would have to get a job as well to pay for the fine. Anthony decided never to drink after that. He said that it wasn't worth it.</p>
