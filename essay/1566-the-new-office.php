				<h1>The New Office (2)</h1>
				<p>  John was very overweight. The new desks and chairs were too small for him. He complained to the boss. The boss told him to lose weight. John quit. Robert had had a private office previously. Now he was out in the middle of the floor with everyone else. He had been with the company for 12 years. He complained to the boss. The boss said, "If you don't like it, leave." Everyone heard him say that. Robert quit. Lisa had allergies. The office ventilation system was not good. Many of her coworkers wore perfume or cologne. She couldn't handle it. Lisa quit. Sam was a vegetarian. Coworkers cooked food in the microwave every day. They ate at their desks. Sam smelled hamburger and pizza every day. Sam quit. "Everyone's quitting," the assistant manager told the boss. "That's okay," said the boss. "I can hire new workers at cheaper salaries."  </p>
