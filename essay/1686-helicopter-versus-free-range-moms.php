				<h1>Helicopter versus Free-Range Moms</h1>
				<p>The opposite of the helicopter mom is the free-range mom. The free-range mom follows a slow parenting style, meaning she lets her kid explore the world at their own pace with little direction. The name free-range comes from the idea that kids should have the freedom to explore their world or range in a way that makes sense to them. This often means that free-range moms will not schedule activities like extra classes or play dates for their kids. Instead a free-range mom will just let her child play in a park. There is less of an emphasis on things like the latest toys.</p>
