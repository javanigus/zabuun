				<h1>Is There Life on the Moon?</h1>
				<p>  The moon is in the sky. He looks at the moon. It is round and white. It is bright. It has mountains. It has valleys. It has rocks. It has dirt. He thinks about the moon. He wonders about it. Maybe there is water on the moon. Maybe tiny animals live on the moon.  </p>
