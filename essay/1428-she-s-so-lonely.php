				<h1>She's So Lonely</h1>
				<p>  She lived in New York City. He lived in Los Angeles. They were in love. "I feel so lonely," she said. She was crying. "Your family is in Los Angeles. You have your brothers. You have your sisters. You have your parents. Who do I have? I don't have anyone. I don't have any brothers. I don't have any sisters. My parents are in China. I come home to my apartment every night. No one tells me hello. No one gives me a hug. No one gives me a kiss. I have a big, empty apartment. I hate it. It's so big. It's so empty." She cried some more. She blew her nose. "When are you moving here?" she asked. He said, "My boss won't let me move there for another six months. My boss won't let me move there now." She said, "Who is more important--your boss, or me?"  </p>
