				<h1>Cloud Watching</h1>
				<p>  Christina and her son like to cloud watch. They went outside. They put down a towel. They lay down on it. They looked up at the sky. Christina pointed at a cloud. "What do you think that one looks like?" she asked. Her son looked at the cloud. "It looks like a man chasing a deer," he said. She was surprised. "I think it looks like a girl crying," she said. Her son laughed at her. "What do you think that one looks like?" he asked. "That one just looks like a regular cloud," she said. "I think it looks like you," her son said. She shook her head and laughed.   </p>
