				<h1>A Bridal Shower</h1>
				<p>While many bridal showers are surprises, others are planned with input from the bride-to-be. A bridal shower can be small and intimate and held in someone's home. It can also be a larger affair held at a restaurant or a catering hall. Sometimes snacks and desserts are served or a full meal can be offered. Traditionally bridal showers were women only affairs. However, more and more showers are no co-ed, with men and women. Traditionally men are not invited to bridal showers but now more showers include men and the groom-to-be. Like many parties in the U.S., there would be no dancing at the bridal shower, just eating and people chatting. Some bridal showers even have games.</p>
