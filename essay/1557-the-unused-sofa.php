				<h1>The Unused Sofa (1)</h1>
				<p>  The Wilsons invited the Carters to dinner. Mr. Carter was Mr. Wilson's boss. The Wilsons had a one-bedroom apartment. Their sofa was in the living room. It seated two people. It still looked new. They protected the sofa with towels. They spread the towels on top of the cushions. They removed the towels when friends visited. Mrs. Wilson spent the day preparing dinner. Mr. Wilson spent the day cleaning the apartment. He also ran some errands. They were both very busy all day. The Carters showed up at 7 p.m. Mr. Wilson walked them to the sofa. "Have a seat," he said. "I'll be right back." He went into the kitchen. When he returned, the Carters were sitting at the dining table. That's strange, he thought. The sofa was much more comfortable than the dining table chairs. He sat down with the Carters at the dining table. They started talking.  </p>
