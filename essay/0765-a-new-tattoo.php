				<h1>A New Tattoo</h1>
				<p> Kevin asked the tattooist to draw a rose on his arm. The tattoo hurt a lot. Kevin couldn't take the pain. He shut his eyes tightly. He did not open them until the tattoo was finished.  "What is that?" yelled Kevin. "It's a rose!" said the tattooist. It looked more like a rock to Kevin. He never got a free tattoo again.  </p>
