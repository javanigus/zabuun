				<h1>Spring Forward, Fall Back</h1>
				<p>  "Daylight Saving Time starts tomorrow. Please change my clock," his wife said. John said he would try. John hated changing clocks twice a year. He never changed his car clock. He couldn't figure out how to do it. His car clock was wrong from March to November. His wife's clock was on her nightstand. It was a clock and a timer. It ran on a single battery. The clock had many buttons. John pressed "Clock." Nothing happened. He pressed "Hour." Nothing happened. He pressed both buttons at the same time. Nothing happened. He pressed "Start." He pressed "Stop." He pressed "Recall." He pressed "Clear." He pressed "Minute." He pressed "Second." He pressed "T1." He pressed "T2." Nothing happened. He pressed his head between his hands. His wife walked in. "Oh, I forgot to tell you," she said. "You have to press the button on the BACK of the clock first."  </p>
