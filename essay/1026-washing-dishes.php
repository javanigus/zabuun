				<h1>Washing Dishes</h1>
				<p> There was a knock at the apartment door. Clary opened it. It was their neighbor Eli. "I couldn't help, but overheard your argument. I was thinking maybe I could wash all your dishes for $40," he said. The girls would have to pay $10 each. They decided it was worth it. If Eli washed it, none of them would have to deal with it.</p>
