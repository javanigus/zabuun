				<h1>A Hot Risk</h1>
				<p> Toby called 911. When they came, they told Toby that Bryan fainted from the heat. "You shouldn't be out on a day like this," the emergency response team said. Toby rode with Bryan to the hospital. Toby even sat beside Bryan as he was unconscious. An hour later, Bryan was up. Toby hugged him. "You're totally red!" Bryan said. Toby looked in the mirror and saw that his face was sunburnt. </p>
