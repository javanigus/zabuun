				<h1>What is in a Lease (2)</h1>
				<p>Your landlord is supposed to have access to the apartment you are renting from them. This doesn't mean they can just barge in whenever. It does mean though that with notice, the landlord is allowed to come into the apartment during a reasonable time, meaning not in the middle of the night when you are sleeping. During this time the landlord will inspect the apartment to make sure you are following the rules and the landlord can also make any necessary repairs. All of this should be written out on the lease. If it is not, do not be afraid to ask the landlord to add that information. It protects both the landlord and you.</p>
