				<h1>USPS Redelivery (2)</h1>
				<p>  Jean opened her mailbox. She saw the postal form. It said, "Insured package. Sorry we missed you. Call for redelivery: 1-800-275-8777." She went upstairs to her apartment. She called the 800 number. A phone menu voice said, "Thank you for calling USPS. Let's begin. You can say Delivery Services." Jean said, "Delivery Services." The voice said, "You can say Redelivery." Jean said, "Redelivery." The voice said, "You can say Schedule a Redelivery." Jean said, "Schedule a redelivery." The voice didn't understand her. Jean said, "Representative." A female USPS representative said, "Hello. How can I help you?" Jean asked for a redelivery the next day. The representative said, "No problem. You'll get your package tomorrow. Here's your tracking number. Remember, you can depend on USPS." The next day, the mailman came and went. He did not redeliver the package. Jean called the 800 number again.  </p>
