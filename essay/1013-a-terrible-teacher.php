				<h1>A Terrible Teacher</h1>
				<p> Ms. Robins was called into the principal's office. "What's up?" she asked. "There have been some concerns over your behavior," the principal said. "I know where this is going," Ms. Robins said. "Do you? Well, it has to change. I know you don't want to be here, but you can't get paid if all your students want you gone," the principal said. Ms. Robins was more careful since her meeting with the principal.</p>
