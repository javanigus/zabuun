				<h1>Make Some Coffee</h1>
				<p>  She took the bag of coffee beans out of the freezer. She kept them in the freezer because the instructions on the bag said that is the best place. She poured the beans into the grinder. She pressed the grinder button for 10 seconds. Now she had ground coffee. She put a paper filter into a plastic cone. She put the cone on top of a coffee cup. She poured the ground coffee into the cone. Then she poured hot water into the cone. The hot water dripped through the ground coffee. She waited until the cup was full of hot coffee. She threw away the filter and the ground coffee. She took her cup of coffee to the dining room table. She sipped her coffee while she read the newspaper.  </p>
