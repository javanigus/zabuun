				<h1>A Pre-Paid Cell Phone Plan</h1>
				<p>The clerk at the cell phone store was very helpful. He was willing to work with Nancy to find a cell phone plan that worked with her budget. He checked Nancy's credit and found out that her credit rating was not very high. He told Nancy that this didn't mean she couldn't have a cell phone. Nancy could get a no-contract or pre-paid cell phone. The clerk explained to Nancy that her credit would not be checked, and she wouldn't have to sign a contract that tied her to a specific phone or service. With a pre-paid phone, she would pay the same amount of money every month. The cost depended on how many minutes she wanted to be able to talk, how much text messaging she planned on doing, and if she was going to use the phone to access the Internet. A pre-paid phone plan meant that Nancy would not get a special deal on a phone though. She would have to pay full price and no special discounts would apply. Nancy had some choices to make.</p>
