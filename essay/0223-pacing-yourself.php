				<h1>Pacing Yourself</h1>
				<p>  Everyone has to do the mile run test. Most people take it in middle school. The girls have to complete the mile under 12 minutes. The guys have to complete the mile under 10 minutes. Most people passed. Some people failed. They had to take it again. Michelle failed it. She was doing well in the beginning. She was in front of everyone. But she got tired. She started walking. She finished the mile in 17 minutes. She knew what to do the next time. She was going to go a steady pace. Not too fast, not too slow.   </p>
