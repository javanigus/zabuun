				<h1>Vegetarian Family</h1>
				<p> "You know what Nick? Why don't we all become vegetarians for this whole month?" We can all explain together why we're vegetarians. It'll be healthier for us too!" his dad said. Nick appreciated his dad's suggestion. "That's too hard for me," Myron said. "Well Myron, it would be good if you laid off the meat for a while," Nick said. The boys and their parents went to the barbeque party and didn't eat meat. They felt surprisingly good!</p>
