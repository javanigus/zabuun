				<h1>City Hosts 42nd Art Fair</h1>
				<p> "This was another successful year for our art fair," said the head librarian. "The artists sold enough of their work to encourage them to return next year, and the library raised almost $700 from sales of various items. We'll use this money to purchase a few more tables and chairs." </p>
