				<h1><b> 14. Getting Locked Out </b></h1>
				<p>  Betty was in front of her apartment. She had a long day. She wanted to take a nap. She looked for her key in her bag. She could not find it. She realized that she left it at school. School was closed now. She could only get her keys tomorrow. She knocked on the door. Nobody answered. She called her roommate. "Hey, when are you coming home?" Betty asked. "Tomorrow morning," her roommate said. Betty called her other roommate. Suddenly, Betty's phone ran out of battery. She got so mad. She decided to sleep over at her neighbor's place.  </p>
