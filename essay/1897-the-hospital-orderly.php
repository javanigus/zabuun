				<h1>The Hospital Orderly (1)</h1>
				<p> Jake was tired of his job. He'd been doing it for 10 years, and it wasn't getting any easier. He was a hospital orderly. That's a vague title that covers many specific duties—some of which are quite unpleasant. Whenever a patient threw up, for example, it was Jake's responsibility to clean the patient's body and face, remove all the soiled clothing and bed linens, put fresh bed linens on the bed, and put clean hospital clothing on the patient. After hundreds of such incidents, Jake still had not gotten used to the odor and sight of fresh vomit. It was disgusting. Every time he cleaned up vomit, he thought to himself that he wasn't getting paid nearly enough.</p>
