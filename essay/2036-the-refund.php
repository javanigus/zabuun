				<h1>The Refund (2)</h1>
				<p> Delbert didn't feel sorry for the manager, the clerk, or the store. Their overcharge policy wasn't posted anywhere for customers to see. The employees knew nothing about it, or else were told to keep quiet about it. Delbert had spent way too much time over the last 15 years trying to figure out Ralfs' tricky and confusing price tags. They owed him a lot more than $5.32 for all his wasted time over all those years.  </p>
