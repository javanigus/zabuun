				<h1>Tuberculosis Still Kills</h1>
				<p> There are some "good" things about the disease of tuberculosis (TB). One is that it can be cured. Another is that TB is not spread by shaking hands, sharing dishes, or sharing clothing. Another is that people usually catch it only from others that they are with constantly—such as family, friends, or coworkers. The occasional cough or sneeze from a nearby stranger doesn't transmit TB.  </p>
