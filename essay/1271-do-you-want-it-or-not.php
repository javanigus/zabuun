				<h1>Do You Want It or Not?</h1>
				<p>  She offered her car to her brother. He said he would think about it. "Let me think about it," he said. She called him up a week later. "Do you want my car for free?" she asked. He said, "I'm thinking about it." She asked, "How long do you have to think about it?" He said he didn't know. "Let me think about it some more," he said. She called up a charity. She said, "Do you want my car for free?" The man at the charity said yes. She asked, "You don't have to think about it?" He said, "No, I don't have to think about it. Who has to think about a free car?" He picked up her car the next day.  </p>
