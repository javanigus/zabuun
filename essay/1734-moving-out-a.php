				<h1>Moving Out (A)</h1>
				<p>The moving van was rented. Belongings had all been safely packaged in boxes. The only problem they had was the furniture. Mike and Maria needed help moving the furniture to their apartment. Mike called his best friend Doug to ask if he could help. Doug said yes without hesitation. Mike, Maria, and Doug all met up the following Saturday at six o'clock of the morning to commence the move.  Doug arrived wearing a thin shirt and shorts. It was going to be a hot day. They packed everything on the van, and went on their way. They shortly arrived at the apartment, and began to unload their things.</p>
