				<h1>Asking for a Favor</h1>
				<p>  I drive my car. It suddenly stops. I go outside to see what is wrong. It's a flat tire! I need to call a tow truck service, but I do not have my phone with me. I see another car coming. I ask the driver if I could borrow his phone. He says, "Of course." What a nice person.  </p>
