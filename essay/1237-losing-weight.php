				<h1>Losing Weight</h1>
				<p>  Kevin wanted to lose weight. He was getting fat. His stomach was getting bigger. He was   gaining weight. He was gaining one pound every week. He had to buy new pants. He didn't fit into his old pants. He couldn't see his feet anymore. When he looked down, all he could see was his big fat belly. He wanted his belly to disappear. How could he do that? How could he lose weight? What could he do? He talked to his wife. She told him to stop eating candy. She told him to stop eating cake. She told him to walk up and down the big hill every day.  </p>
