				<h1>He Hates Carrots</h1>
				<p>  "Eat your vegetables, Mikey," Mom said. "I am eating my vegetables," Mikey said. He was eating the sliced carrots. He was eating the sliced carrots one by one. He was eating them one at a time. He picked up one sliced carrot with his fork. He looked at it. He slowly put it in his mouth. He slowly chewed it. Finally, he swallowed it. Then he drank some water. Then he picked up another sliced carrot with his fork. Mom watched him. "Why do you hate vegetables, Mikey?" He said, "I don't hate vegetables. I hate carrots." "Why do you hate carrots?" Mom asked. "Because they don't taste good," Mikey said. "But they are good for you," Mom said. "They are good for your eyes. They help you to see well. Don't you want to see well?" "Not if I have to see carrots," Mikey said.  </p>
