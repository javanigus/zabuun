				<h1>Jumping Over Fireworks</h1>
				<p>Peter got ready. He tied his shoes to make sure his shoe laces weren't hanging out of his shoes, and that he had enough distance to jump over the sparks. Peter started running and then jumped. When he landed on the other side, he started screaming in pain. A spark had gotten into Peter's eye. He fell to the ground and started asking for ice. Nancy brought him a bag of ice to cover his eye. During the next day, Peter had to get glasses because of the damage he had suffered in his eye. The doctor asked him, "What's the important lesson here?" Peter responded with, "Don't jump over fireworks."</p>
