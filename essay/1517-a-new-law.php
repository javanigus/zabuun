				<h1>A New Law</h1>
				<p>  Ed was riding his bicycle. A dog started chasing him. He yelled at the dog. Then he tried to kick the dog. He lost his balance. He fell off his bike. His head hit the curb. A neighbor saw him fall. She dialed 911. An ambulance arrived. It took Ed to the emergency room. But it was too late. The doctors could not save him. Ed died. Ed was the son of the governor of Texas. The governor and his wife were very sad. The governor didn't want other children to die. He didn't want other parents to suffer. He didn't want them to lose their children. He talked to the state lawmakers. He asked them to pass a new law to protect children. The lawmakers agreed. They were parents, too. They passed a new law to protect children. The governor signed the new law. The new law was a helmet law. Children had to wear a helmet when they rode a bike, or a sled, or a horse. They had to wear a helmet when they snowboarded or skateboarded. "Texas is now a safe state for children," said the governor. "Maybe we're safe," said one boy, "but we're not happy. Helmets suck."  </p>
