				<h1>BK Takes Your Picture</h1>
				<p>  Burger King in Brazil sells burgers. It also takes pictures. It takes pictures of customers. It puts their pictures on the wrappers. It puts the wrappers on the burgers. The customer gets a burger with his picture on the wrapper. There's no extra charge for the picture. It's free. "We do it to bring in more customers," said a BK executive. He said the pictures are attracting customers. He said people like to see their picture. The picture adds a personal touch. "It's like someone calling you by your name," he said. Some customers have complained. They say identity thieves will use the pictures to commit fraud. "We will not allow identity theft," said the BK executive. McDonald's likes the idea. It plans to take pictures of customers, too. But it will put the pictures on wrappers, cups, napkins, and receipts. "BK doesn't think big enough," said a McDonald's executive.  </p>
