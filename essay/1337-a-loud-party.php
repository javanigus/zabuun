				<h1>A Loud Party</h1>
				<p>  "I'm calling the police," Barry said. "I'm glad you're calling the police," Ruth said. Barry and Ruth had a nice house. They had a nice, quiet house. They had nice neighbors. They had nice, quiet neighbors. But tonight, their neighbors were not quiet. They were having a pool party. Everyone was drinking. Everyone was talking loud. Everyone was jumping into the pool. Loud music was playing. Car horns were honking. Barry and Ruth closed all their windows. But they still heard the party. Barry called the police. The policeman said, "We'll be there in an hour or two." Barry asked, "Why not sooner?" "The mayor's having a big party," the policeman said. "Most of our officers are protecting the mayor and his guests."  </p>
