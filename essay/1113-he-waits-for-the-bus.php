				<h1>He Waits for the Bus</h1>
				<p>  He stands at the bus stop. He looks at his watch. He is late. He taps his foot. He looks at his watch again. He looks down the street. He looks for the bus. He sees the bus. It is a block away. It approaches slowly. It finally arrives at the bus stop.  </p>
