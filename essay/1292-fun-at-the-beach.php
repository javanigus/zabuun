				<h1>Fun at the Beach</h1>
				<p>  He was bored. He wanted to do something fun. He wanted to do something fun with his friend. He called up his friend. "I'm bored. Let's do something fun!" he said. His friend said, "That sounds great. I'm glad you called. I'm bored, too. What do you want to do?" He said he wanted to go to the beach. His friend said that sounded great. He picked up his friend in his car. They went to the beach. They threw a Frisbee to each other. They swam in the ocean. They built a big sand castle. They watched the sailboats. They watched the sea gulls. He drove his friend home. "That was fun! Let's do it again sometime," his friend said.  </p>
