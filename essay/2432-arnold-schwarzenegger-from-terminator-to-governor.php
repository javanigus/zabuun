				<h1>Arnold Schwarzenegger: From Terminator to Governor</h1>
				<p>Schwarzenegger was first elected governor in October, 2003, running on a Republican Party platform. He enjoyed moderate success as governor in his first years, but struggled greatly after that. He had many political opponents who cited that he had no political experience, and had won the elections simply because of his popularity. Schwarzenegger's term in office was rocked by sexual misconduct allegations that tainted his political career. He remains a very popular cultural figure in the United States.</p>
