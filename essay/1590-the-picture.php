				<h1>The Picture</h1>
				<p>  Emily and Grant were inside Macy's on 34th Street. Macy's was having its annual flower show. The store was full of flowers. They were beautiful to look at and beautiful to smell. It was like being in a forest or jungle. Flowers were everywhere. The store was packed with people. Everyone inside the store was taking pictures. They took pictures of the flowers. They took pictures of one another standing next to the flowers. People were asking strangers to take their pictures. Emily took pictures of Grant. Grant took pictures of Emily. Emily asked a stranger to take their picture. The stranger took the picture. It was out of focus. Emily asked another stranger to take their picture. It was also out of focus. Grant asked a stranger to take their picture. The picture was in focus. It was a beautiful picture. "The third time is the charm," said Grant.  </p>
