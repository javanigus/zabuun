				<h1>The New Clothes (2)</h1>
				<p> The next evening, Lorraine told Quinn that she had returned two of the tops to the store. When she had tried them on at home that morning, she noticed a smell. Sniffing the tops, she realized that two of them had a perfume odor. Some women had worn the tops long enough to transfer their own perfume to the tops. "It took me almost one hour to select those tops. I couldn't smell the perfume on them last night because that whole store has a candle scent. What a waste of time." </p>
