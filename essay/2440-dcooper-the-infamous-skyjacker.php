				<h1>D.B. Cooper: The Infamous Skyjacker</h1>
				<p>To this date, the Cooper skyjacking is the only case that is unresolved in the United States. Cooper was never found, nor was any evidence of the $200,000, and his parachute. Many believe Cooper could not survive a drop of such a great altitude, while others say the absence of any of the money, or any evidence of his death proves he survived. In any event, D.B. Cooper is a true American legend.</p>
