				<h1>A New Haircut</h1>
				<p> Angie listened to classical music while the hair stylist cut her hair. She tried to fall asleep so she wouldn't have to think about her hair. After 45 minutes, the hair stylist removed the hair towel. "Ta da!" she said. Angie started crying. She thought she looked awful! "You'll feel better once you book jobs," the agent said. Although Angie didn't like her haircut, she admitted that it was going to make her stand out.</p>
