				<h1>Garage Door for Sale</h1>
				<p>  Gary put his garage door for sale online. A man called. Was the garage door in good condition? Did Gary have all the parts? What was the price again? "$465," Gary said. The price was in the ad. The man was testing Gary. He was testing to see if Gary was firm about his price. The man wanted to see the door. Gary invited him over. The man showed up. He examined the door. He liked it. He offered Gary $400. Gary immediately said okay. The man was surprised that Gary agreed so quickly. He said he should have offered Gary $350. Gary said, "No, you should have offered $400. If you had offered a dollar less, I would've said no. I figured you were going to try to lower the price. I had already decided to accept $400. So you don't have to kick yourself for not offering $350."  </p>
