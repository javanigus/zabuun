				<h1>Carl Sagan: Visionary Astronomer</h1>
				<p>Sagan earned his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from the University of Chicago in the 1950s. His scientific curiosity led him into developing the television series "Cosmos". It was one of the most watched science series, and has been recreated and is currently on the air. His work on the Galileo project lives on today. The spacecraft is speeding its way through infinite space today with his message of greeting to whatever race of beings finds it. Sagan died at the age of 62 from complications resulting from pneumonia.</p>
