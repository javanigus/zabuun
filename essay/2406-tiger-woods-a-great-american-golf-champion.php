				<h1>Tiger Woods: A Great American Golf Champion</h1>
				<p>Woods was exposed as a womanizer by several women, following an alleged affair with a New York woman. Woods denied any wrongdoing, but eventually confessed to several "indiscretions". The controversy kept gaining momentum, and it eventually led to his divorce and the loss of endorsement money from the sponsors. Woods is back on the tour, but has not regained his proficiency as before.</p>
