				<h1>The Package Pick-Up (1)</h1>
				<p>  The phone rang at 8:15 a.m. It was a recording. "A UPS driver will pick up your package today. He will arrive between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m." That's nice, Craig thought. All I have to do is wait for 11 hours. I can't even take a shower. I can't hear the doorbell while I'm in the shower. Craig heard the doorbell at 4:40 p.m. "I'm so glad you're here," he told the driver. "This box has been sitting in my bedroom for two weeks." He handed the box to the driver. The driver said, "Where's the call tag? I can't take this without the call tag." Craig said, "What? What's a call tag?" The driver said, "A call tag is a return label. It tells us where to ship the box. Maybe it's inside the box." Craig rolled his eyes. Why was returning a package so difficult?  </p>
