				<h1>A Butterfinger Candy Bar</h1>
				<p>  She looks at the candy bar. It says Butterfinger on the wrapper. She takes off the wrapper. She throws it into the trashcan. She bites into the candy. She chews it. It tastes good. She swallows it. She takes another bite. Soon the candy bar is all gone. Nothing remains except the wrapper.  </p>
