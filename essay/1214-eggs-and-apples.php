				<h1>Eggs and Apples</h1>
				<p>  Emma went to the market. She needed to buy food. She needed brown eggs. She opened a carton of brown eggs. She looked at the eggs. None of them were cracked. None of them were broken. All the eggs were okay. She closed the carton. She put the carton of eggs in her shopping cart. She needed red apples. She looked at a bag of red apples. She looked for dark spots on the apples. She looked for worm holes in the apples. She didn't see any dark spots or worm holes. She put the bag of apples in her shopping cart.  </p>
