Joe is ahead of her. But Joe is a slow runner. Andrea taps him on the shoulder. Joe falls down. He starts crying. A teacher runs towards him. "Did you push him down, Andrea?" the teacher asked. "No! He tripped. I just tapped his shoulder," Andrea said. The teacher did not believe her. She asks Joe if Andrea pushed her. He said no. The teacher said sorry to Andrea.   </p>
