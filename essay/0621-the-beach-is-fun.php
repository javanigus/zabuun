				<h1>The Beach is Fun</h1>
				<p>  You can do a lot of things at the beach. You can lie down on a towel. Remember to put sunblock on. You don't want your skin to burn. You can make sandcastles. Show your creativity! You can surf in the water. Watch out for the big waves! Finally, you can watch the sunset.  </p>
