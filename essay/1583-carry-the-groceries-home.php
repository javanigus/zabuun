				<h1>Carry the Groceries Home (1)</h1>
				<p>  In New York City, grocery stores are hard to find. It's a lucky person who lives within a block of a grocery store. Delis and little restaurants are everywhere, but grocery stores are few and far between. The closest grocery store to Brian was Gristedes. It was six blocks from his apartment. Friday he went shopping. It was a 25-minute walk to Gristedes. It was a 35-minute walk back. On the way back, Brian had to stop every block to rest. He put the four heavy plastic bags on the sidewalk. He stood next to them. He stretched his fingers. He stretched his arms. He stretched his back. There's got to be a better way, he thought. There is. Many people buy personal shopping carts. They cost as little as $20. But Brian didn't want to spend $20 on a shopping cart. Maybe I can invent something, he thought.  </p>
