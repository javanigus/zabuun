				<h1>He Will Work for Gas</h1>
				<p>  Doug went to the gas station. "Can I have a job?" he asked. The owner said, "Maybe you can have a job. Can you count money? Can you put gas in a car?" "Yes," said Doug. "I can count money. I can put gas in a car. So, can I have a job?" "There is just one problem," said the owner. "I cannot pay you with money." "You cannot pay me with money?" asked Doug. "What good is that? What will you pay me with—bananas?" "No," said the owner. "I won't pay you with bananas. You aren't a monkey, are you? No, I will pay you with gasoline. I have lots of gasoline." "It's a deal. My car uses lots of gasoline," said Doug. </p>
