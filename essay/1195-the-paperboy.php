				<h1><b> 46. The Paperboy </b></h1>
				<p>  Billy is the paperboy in his town. He rides on his bike every day from 12 p.m. to 3 p.m. He throws a newspaper at every house he passes by. He loves his job. He loves it because he loves to ride his bike. He loves it because he loves the fact that everyone in town knows him. He gets a decent amount of money, too. He met his girlfriend while he was working. Two years ago, he accidentally threw a newspaper on her head. It looked like it hurt! He got off his bike. He checked on her. She said it was okay. He thought she was beautiful. The rest was history.  </p>
