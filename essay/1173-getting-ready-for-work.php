				<h1><b> 24. Getting Ready for Work </b></h1>
				<p>  Susan works at the mall. She is a cashier at a clothing store. She'll start work in an hour. She has a big bag she takes to work every day. She puts her lunch inside. It's an apple and a sandwich. She puts her water bottle inside. She puts her name tag inside. She puts her wallet inside. She puts her car keys inside. She puts her phone inside. She changes into her uniform. It is a black polo shirt. She can wear any pants she wants. She drives to work. She puts her bag in a locker. She clocks in. She goes to a cash register. She sees her first customer.  </p>
