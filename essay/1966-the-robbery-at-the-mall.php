				<h1>The Robbery at the Mall (2)</h1>
				<p> The officer shook his head. "Not good," he said. He told Cliff that robberies like this one happened daily throughout southern California. "Thugs are everywhere, prowling around like sharks in the ocean, looking for prey." Cliff asked the officer what could be done. "I know this sounds ridiculous, but we police can no longer protect you law-abiding citizens. There's simply too many criminals. Tell all your female relatives and friends one thing: Don't go anywhere alone, day or night. A woman by herself, even in public, might as well be carrying a bright neon sign that says: 'Victim here—Come and get me!' I'm not supposed to be telling you this, because if the word gets out, tourism will suffer in southern California."</p>
