				<h1>Flying Alone for the First Time</h1>
				<p>  Rebecca was going to Texas to visit her relatives. Her mom and dad had to go to work. This was her first time flying alone. She was flying from California. Rebecca was very scared at first. When she got on the plane, she was nervous. The plane began to take off. Rebecca calmed down after the plane steadied. This was not as bad as she thought. Rebecca was okay now. She listened to music. She had a nice conversation. The view from above was also nice. She began to like the plane ride. It was not as scary as she thought it would be.   </p>
