				<h1>Train Wreck "Frees" Cows</h1>
				<p>  "We know who did this," said a California Highway Patrol spokesman. "The train was sabotaged by a group called Tofu for You. They left their pamphlets all over the crime scene. They 'liberate' animals that are on their way to the slaughterhouse. They think Americans should eat tofu instead of meat. They're wasting their time. All these cows are going to be burgers by tomorrow night."  </p>
