				<h1>A Pet Mouse</h1>
				<p> Betty didn't let what her neighbor said discourage her. She continued putting up "Lost Mouse" signs. Betty then heard a scream. "Ew, it's a mouse!" someone cried out loud. Betty followed the scream and it led her to the gas station, where she found Augustus. She grabbed him and hugged him tightly.</p>
