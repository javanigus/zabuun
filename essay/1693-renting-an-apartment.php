				<h1>Renting an Apartment (1)</h1>
				<p>There are two ways to rent an apartment. Most landlords rent out apartments on an annual basis. This means you will sign a document called a lease, which says you will stay in the property for one year and pay rent on a monthly basis. If you decide that you want to break the lease, or leave before your year is up, there are usually fines you will have to pay. Another way to rent an apartment is on a month-to-month basis. This means that you pay by month, and are not obligated to stay for more than a month at a time.</p>
