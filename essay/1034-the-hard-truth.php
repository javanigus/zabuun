				<h1>The Hard Truth</h1>
				<p> Harold told his parents about the competition. His mom and dad nervously looked at each other. They didn't want him to find out that he was actually not a good artist. They told Harold what they really thought of his artwork. "So you don't think I'm good?" he asked. They shook their heads. Harold was so upset that he tore up his art. He locked himself in his room. At night, his parents went to his room to give him his dinner. "Son, we feel really bad. We think it's great that you want to keep drawing, so your mother and I decided to sign you up for art lessons," Harold's dad said. Harold ran up to his parents and gave them a hug.</p>
