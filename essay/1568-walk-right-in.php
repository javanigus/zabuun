				<h1>Walk Right In</h1>
				<p>  Bill walked to the front door of his apartment. Someone had slipped a piece of paper under the door. It was a notice from the manager. They were going to spray his apartment for bugs. He didn't have any bugs. They would spray Friday morning. Friday morning he was in the bathroom. He heard a knock at the door. He was shaving. He rinsed his face. He heard the door open. "Bug spraying!" the worker said. Bill couldn't believe it. The worker hadn't waited for Bill to come to the door. He had just knocked on the door and immediately entered. Some people shouldn't have master keys, Bill thought. He yelled to the worker, "No spraying today!" The worker said okay and walked out. Does anyone have patience anymore, Bill wondered. On future spraying days, he would leave the chain on his front door. A chain beats a master key.  </p>
