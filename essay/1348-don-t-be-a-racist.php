				<h1>Don't Be a Racist</h1>
				<p>  Ray called up the newspaper reporter. "You wrote about a bank robbery. You described the bank robber," he said. "Why did you describe him?" The reporter said, "We want the public to help find him. If someone sees him, they can call the police." Ray said, "But why didn't you tell us his race? You said he was about 35 and about 5 feet 7 inches.  But you didn't tell us his race. That would help a lot." "Our lawyers say we can't. It's racist," said the reporter. "The robber can sue us for being racist." "Well, don't report his age, either," said Ray. "That's ageist. Don't report his height. That's 'heightist.' Don't report his sex. That's sexist."  "That doesn't leave much to report," said the reporter. "Just report this," said Ray. "A human being robbed a bank. Please look for a human being who looks like he or she robbed a bank."  </p>
