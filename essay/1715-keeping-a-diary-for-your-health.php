				<h1>Keeping a Diary for Your Health</h1>
				<p>The key to successful diary keeping is not editing, which means not stopping any thoughts from coming through. This even means allowing thoughts that disturb you to come out in your writing. It helps clarify your feelings, and is especially useful if a person is faced with a hard decision. Sometimes just writing down the pros and cons help you better understand an issue. You begin to see a problem from different angles. This is helpful if you are having a disagreement with others.</p>
