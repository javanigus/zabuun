				<h1>Diving at the Swimming Pool</h1>
				<p>One of Donald's favorite things to do at the pool was to go on the diving board. As Donald stood on the edge of the diving board, he started jumping in order to get high enough to do a flip. He jumped once, and then twice. When he was about to jump off again, he saw that Sarah was looking at him from the entrance of the pool. Donald got so nervous that he couldn't finish the flip, and he landed on his back. Everyone in the deep end of the pool started laughing. Donald felt embarrassed as he swam to the edge of the pool, but when he got there he saw Sarah waiting for him. "Ouch, that had to hurt. You want to go swimming with me?" Sarah asked Donald. Donald said sure nervously, and started swimming with Sarah. Donald had never been happier, and never been in that much pain.</p>
