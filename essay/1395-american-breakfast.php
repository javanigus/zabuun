				<h1>American Breakfast</h1>
				<p>  She was running late. She wanted a fast breakfast. She didn't have time to make her own breakfast. Her usual breakfast was rice, vegetables, and meat. "Will you make me a fast breakfast?" she asked her boyfriend. He was American. She was Asian. He preferred cereal for breakfast. He grabbed a box of cereal. He grabbed a bowl and a spoon. He took a carton of milk out of the refrigerator. He grabbed a banana. "Here's something fast for you," he said. He put everything on the dining table. She looked at the box of cereal. "Let me try this first," she said. She put a few flakes of cereal into her mouth. She ate them. "Yuck," she said. "How can you eat this? It's so dry." "Well, that's what the milk and banana are for," he said. She said forget it. She grabbed the banana and went to work.  </p>
