				<h1>Monkeys Cause Man's Death</h1>
				<p> "Our monkeys are getting out of control," said a neighbor. He said he had already barricaded his balcony with barbed wire. "It's ugly, I must admit. A balcony shouldn't look like the outside of a prison. My neighbors want me to take it down. They say the barbed wire might injure the monkeys and it's unsightly. But I'll bet that some of my neighbors will be going to the hardware store tomorrow." </p>
