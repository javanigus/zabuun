				<h1>Se Habla English</h1>
				<p>  Alex wanted to become a citizen. He signed up for a citizenship class. He went to the first class. The teacher spoke only Spanish. All the other students spoke only Spanish. Alex spoke Spanish, too. He asked the teacher, "Why are you speaking Spanish? We need to speak English. We need to understand English. We need to read English. We need to write English." The teacher said, "Don't worry. English isn't important anymore. My students never fail the interview. Can you say Yes in English? Can you say No in English? Then your English is good enough. You want to become a citizen. That is more important than your English." Alex dropped out. He signed up for another citizenship class. The teacher spoke only English.  </p>
