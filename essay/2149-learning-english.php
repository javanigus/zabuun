				<h1>Learning English</h1>
				<p> "We want everyone in Las Casas to speak English," said Ivan Libby, administrator of the school district. "They don't have to speak fluent English, of course, just survival English—how to give and get directions, order food, visit the doctor, read labels on food and medicines—the basic stuff. Once they're able to read and write more English, they'll be able to get better work and they'll be more confident. We hope this confidence will inspire some of them to go on to get their high school diploma and perhaps even get a degree from a community college or a university.</p>
